<h3><i>Of the Cure of Inflammation.</i></h3>

<p>In attempting the cure of inflammation,
or its consequences, we must naturally
be directed to the means of removal, by
the nature of the action itself, and the
object which we have in view. The<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
treatment of the inflammatory action
may be considered in two points of
view; first, as this action consists in peculiar
changes of the natural action,
which changes we wish to remove; and,
secondly, as this action naturally tends
to disappear, and produce other actions,
which require a peculiar treatment. The
observations, therefore, which are to be
made upon the method of cure, may be
arranged under the heads of the different
terminations of inflammation.</p>


<h3><i>Of the Treatment necessary to procure Resolution.</i></h3>

<p>In the treatment of most wounds, our
chief intention is to prevent the accession
of inflammation, and procure adhesion,
which is, in one respect, analogous to resolution.
When inflammation has taken<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
place, either in wounds, or in other cases,
our great object is, to remove or lessen it
as quickly as possible, which we effect,
first, by removing the exciting causes of
inflammation, or such causes as tend to
increase the action; and, secondly, by
applying such remedies as tend directly
to abate the inflammatory action.</p>

<p>Upon the propriety of removing the
exciting causes, and the manner of doing
so, very little requires to be said. If any
acrid, or stimulating substance, has been
applied to the skin, or any extraneous
body been forced into it, these must be
removed before the inflammation can be
resolved; because, if they be allowed to
remain, they will keep up the action so
long, and to such a degree, that suppuration
will be produced, or gangrene, if
the part be very sensible, (as, for instance,
the cutis) or if the exciting cause be very<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
irritating. Acrid substances are to be
removed by ablution with water, which
is in general much better than the solutions
which are proposed upon the principle
of chemically combining with the
acrid; because these generally are likewise
acrid, or stimulating, and increase
still more the inflammation which has
taken place, before they can combine
with the substance which was formerly
applied, and become neutralised. This
may be illustrated by the operations of
acids and alkalis. If heat have been applied,
so as to induce inflammation, we
must remove the superabundant quantity
of heat, but must not apply cold; because
we then do mischief, as will be afterwards
mentioned.</p>

<p>When a substance is forced into the
skin, so as to stimulate mechanically, we
must endeavour to lay hold of it, and<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
pull it out; but if it have penetrated so
deep as to make this impracticable, we
must then enlarge the wound, and remove
it; because we thus may enable
the wound to heal by the first intention.
If, however, the injury done be great, if
the part be much bruised, or the extraneous
substances be numerous, we may
be less anxious about the extraction of
such as require much trouble; because
the irritation which is thus given will
tend to increase the degree of inflammation,
and, very probably, its extent, at
the same time, that, from the original
injury, there is little prospect of adhesion
being procured, or suppuration prevented.
We are then chiefly to search
after, and extract foreign bodies, when
we apprehend that their removal may
permit the inflammation to be resolved,
and adhesion to take place, and when we
expect that their presence will excite a<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
greater action than our endeavours to
extract them will do. This is a rule
which ought to be carefully remembered
by every surgeon, and especially by those
whose situation makes them be daily
called to take the management of gun-shot
wounds. They are not brought to
their patient to show how much they
can do in the way of cutting and probing;
it is their duty to administer relief,
and act so as to prevent and abate
the inflammatory action, which they will
often do most effectually by letting their
patient alone, and throwing aside their
ball-screws and forceps.</p>

<p>The circumstance of being in an unusual
situation, in which the natural action
cannot possibly be continued, is also
a very frequent cause, producing inflammation,
and preventing its resolution.
We ought, upon this principle, which<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
has been formerly mentioned, to endeavour,
in almost every instance, to bring
the sides of the wound together, if an
wound has been the exciting cause of inflammation,
by which we shall much
more readily prevent or overcome the
inflammatory action; because we thus
bring the parts nearly to their natural
situation, with respect to interstice, and
thus make the organic particles be more
readily thrown <span class="nowrap">out<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>. This practice
ought to be pushed farther than is often<span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
done. Even in many contused wounds it
will be useful; because, although union
may not be immediately produced, yet,
when the contused part is either recovered,
or absorbed, the inflammatory action
may be prevented, or removed, by
the restoration of the natural action, if
the part be in absolute contact. It must,
however, be remembered, that if much
difficulty be experienced in bringing and
retaining the parts together, owing to
the swelling, from the previous existence
of the diseased action, then our endeavour
will be hurtful; because the irritation
which we thus give, has a greater
power to increase the action, than the
circumstance of the parts being in contact,
has to diminish the inflammation,
and restore the natural action.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span></p>
<p>By removing, then, the exciting causes
of inflammation, before the action be induced,
we shall frequently prevent it altogether
from being formed; but, even
although we should be disappointed, we,
by this removal, render the disease milder,
less extensive, and much more easily
overcome; for, as long as the exciting
causes continue to operate, it is impossible
to procure resolution; but the action
will be kept up until some other
termination, or consequence, be induced.
But, although we thus prevent the action
from being raised to so great a degree as
it otherwise would be, yet we do not immediately
overcome or destroy it; because
the action, when once induced,
has, like every other action, a tendency
to continue for some time after its cause
is withdrawn. This continuance may
be longer or shorter, according to circumstances,<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
and its termination may be
more or less unfavourable. We are,
therefore, under the necessity of employing
such remedies as have a power of
directly diminishing or removing this
action. It has, however, been doubted,
whether they ought, in every instance,
to be employed; or, in other words,
whether resolution ought uniformly to
be desired. It has, for instance, been
deemed unsafe to check those inflammations
which depended upon a general or
constitutional specific disease, or occurred
during its existence. But this opinion,
which was evidently founded upon the
supposition of the operation of morbid
humours, cannot be maintained, now
that this is given up. Granting inflammation,
in every one of these cases, to be
dependent upon the general disease, and
to exist as a symptom of it, no harm can<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
accrue from resolving <span class="nowrap">it<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>; because, if
the inflammation have once taken place,
the full effect of the general disease is
produced, which, therefore, cannot be
affected by the peculiarity of the termination
of this inflammation, unless it be
proved, that some humour be sent there
to be concocted and thrown out. In
many instances, inflammation occurs in
a general disease, merely as an accidental
circumstance; but, even in those cases
where the local inflammation is most decidedly
dependent on the general action,
and is perhaps essential to it, we find,
that no bad effects follow from resolving
the inflammation; and, if this be the
case with regard to specific inflammation,
we may still more certainly extend the<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
principle to the treatment of the simple
inflammatory action, with which we
have at present a more immediate connection.
There are, however, some inflammatory
affections which we sometimes
cannot put back; such as those tumors
which succeed the small-pox; but,
when we do succeed, no bad consequence
follows; and the failure of some of our
attempts can be no argument against the
general plan, more than our failure in
many other instances.</p>

<p>Resolution is the quickest termination
of inflammation, and, therefore,
ought, perhaps in every instance, to be
attempted, unless in cases where the injury
is such that suppuration is unavoidable;
as, for instance, extensive bruises,
&amp;c. It is our great object, even in those
inflammations which we raise intentionally;
as, for instance, in the operation for<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
hydrocele. At one time, however, this
was not admitted without limitation;
and suppuration was, in many instances,
anxiously sought for, being considered by
some as the only way of obtaining a
cure. “Union, (says Mr. O’Halloran)
without suppuration, by an immediate
coalescence, or by the first intention,
is merely chimerical, and is opposite
to the rules of nature. Inflammation
(contrary to the received canon)
is not the time for a reunion of
divided parts: This happy minute follows,
not precedes suppuration.” It
was timidity, with regard to the prevention
of suppuration, and want of knowledge
of the powers of the animal frame,
which so long retarded the progress of
surgery, and prevented the improvement
of its operations.</p>

<p>The remedies which we employ, with<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
the intention of abating and removing
the inflammatory action, are either general
or topical.</p>

<p>General remedies are perhaps only
useful, or have only a superiority over topical
ones, when a general disease, or fever,
accompanies the local inflammation.
Topical ones are only to be trusted to
alone, when the disease is entirely local.</p>

<p>The general remedies, are naturally
such as tend to abate action in general,
or to diminish the natural action; and,
therefore, will consist of bleeding, cold,
purging, sweating, nauseating medicines,
and some of the agentes dissimiles.</p>

<p>Bleeding is justly considered as the
most powerful, and the most useful of all
those remedies; and, in many cases, is
the only one which can accomplish a<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
cure. The quantity of blood which it
is necessary to detract, will be regulated
by the effect of the inflammation upon
the system, and by the previous condition
of the person, with regard to
strength; for those who are weak bear
bleeding worst; and in them we cannot
repeat it so frequently, as in the robust.
Delay in them is, however, more dangerous;
because the inflammation makes a
more rapid progress, and, therefore, we
ought sooner to push our remedies.</p>

<p>When the system is affected, in consequence
of inflammation of vital parts,
the general action is greater than when
other parts are affected, and, therefore,
bleeding must be used earlier, and
with more freedom. Mr. Hunter observes,
that when these parts are inflamed,
the patient bears bleeding worse than
when parts are affected which are not<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
vital; but this observation must not be
admitted indefinitely. When these parts
are affected, the action is so violent, that
the power cannot long support it; and,
therefore, we must have early recourse to
the lancet, and allow the blood to flow until
the pain diminishes, and ceases to abate
any more, and until the pulse becomes softer,
and perhaps fuller. This is the time to
stop; but, whenever the pain returns, or the
pulse becomes hard, the orifice should be
again opened, although we had bled only
half an hour before. The system, in this
way, is not weakened, nor the action
sunk so low as to injure the power of
recovery, which might be the case, were
we to bleed too copiously at once. This
remark applies, in a particular degree, to
inflammation of the bowels; but it may
also be extended to pulmonic inflammation;
only, in this case, we can detract
more blood at a time than in the other<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
instance; because the system sympathises
less strongly with the lungs, and, therefore,
general evacuation will be longer
of operating on the local disease. The
same cause, however, makes the danger
less; because the general action is not
raised so high, and the part itself not being
so delicate, can support the action
longer, and, consequently, the danger is
less. It is an established point, that no
action can subside, or be destroyed suddenly,
and the patient become free from
disease. All morbid actions must subside,
more or less slowly, and, therefore,
bleeding ought not at once to be pushed
so far as to produce fainting, unless the
patient be very liable to faint. This
sudden cessation of general action does
not destroy the specific nature of the action
which is going on when it is induced,
but rather leaves the parts stationary,
the tendency to morbid action<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
still continuing, although the capability
to act be suspended for a <span class="nowrap">moment<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>. In
place, then, of bleeding so as to exhaust
the strength quickly, and endeavour, as
it were, by the quantity of the discharge,
to destroy the disease by one bleeding, it
will be much better to bleed just until
we produce the feeling of weakness to a
moderate extent, and abate, to a certain
degree, the pain and hardness of the
pulse; stopping, whenever we find that
we are not abating it farther, distinguishing,
however, betwixt real abatement
and syncope, or want of power to
act and feel. We then repeat the evacuation,
whenever the hardness of the
pulse and pain return; and thus, perhaps<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
in one day, and with infinitely more benefit,
bleed much more frequently, and,
perhaps, to a greater extent than is sometimes
done in a week, by those who
bleed more copiously at once, and repeat
it seldomer.</p>

<p>Concerning the exact quantity of
blood, which ought, in the different varieties
of inflammation, to be detracted,
I hold it, from the above principle, to be
ridiculous to give any direction; because
no general rule can be given, by which
we may, a priori, determine the quantity.
We are to bleed until we procure
an abatement of the action; and to stop
whenever this abatement ceases to be
really <span class="nowrap">progressive<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span>. We are to renew
the bleeding, whenever the action again<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
increases, and stop, as before, whenever it
is abated, remembering, that, after some
time, a more sparing detraction will produce
a greater effect, than a more copious
one would do, in the commencement
of the disease. It must also be attended
to, that, owing to the weakness induced
by the disease, and by the bleedings, we
must, toward the end, bleed at longer intervals;
for, if we continue to bleed in
the same way as formerly, we would either
kill the patient, or at least prevent
the act of restoration from taking place;
because we would thus diminish the
power, or vital energy, which was to
perform this act. Those, then, who order
a certain number of ounces to be
taken away, must reason upon probability,
and prescribe less efficaciously, than
those who direct no determinate quantity,
but regulate their practice by the
effects. It is equally foolish in those<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
who order bleeding, pro viribus, and are
satisfied with this until their next stated
visit; because bleeding until fainting
takes place, and not repeating it for some
time afterwards, may be doing a great
deal too little.</p>

<p>As there is a proper time for stopping
each individual evacuation, so also is
there a period at which we ought to stop
the general plan of cure by bleeding, or
at least to intermit it. And to determine
when this period is come, is sometimes
a pretty nice point, and one of
much importance; because, if we stop
too soon, we allow the action still to go
on, and, perhaps, to terminate fatally.
On the other hand, if we bleed too long,
we sink the parts below the state necessary
for recovery, and even accelerate the
unfavourable termination. When, for
instance, from the state of the pulse, and<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
other circumstances, we apprehend the
accession of gangrene, bleeding will not
abate pain, but will bring on the mortification
sooner, and make it spread farther,
as will be afterwards mentioned.</p>

<p>As the accession of inflammation depends
upon a change of the natural action
of the vital principle, so does its removal
depend upon the reconversion of
this into the natural action, which implies
activity, or an active state. If, then,
we bleed in the end of inflammation, we
lessen the powers of the part so much, as
to prevent restoration; gangrene, therefore,
will take place: Or, if the part be
less delicate, and the progress of the action
consequently slower, the inflammation
may continue stationary for a considerable
time, and become chronic, or habitual.
This state is not to be cured by
bleeding, but will rather be made worse<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
by it. Whenever, then, after inflammation
has continued for a length of time,
we find, that venesection does not produce
the usual abatement; or, whenever,
although there be a temporary abatement,
the pain increases afterwards to a
greater degree, we may be certain our
treatment is improper. We likewise find,
that the longer bleeding has been delayed,
in the beginning of the disease,
the sooner must we stop, and the less
quantity must we take at a time; because,
in this case, the inflammatory action
is nearer its termination, and is
more ready to produce gangrene, if the
parts be delicate, or the action great, or,
if otherwise, the inflammatio assuefacta.
We are also to refrain from bleeding,
when we find that the inflammatory action
is about to terminate in another action;
as, for instance, the suppurative;
because, in the first place, bleeding, in<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
this new action, can do no good, but,
by weakening, will do harm; and, secondly,
if there be only a tendency to
this action, the action not being yet
formed, or beginning to form, we may,
by bleeding, interrupt the progress of
the inflammation, and convert it into a
more tedious disease, or the inflammatio
assuefacta.</p>

<p>Bleeding has been used, not only as
a cure for inflammation, but also as a
preventative; but this must be considered
as proper, only in particular instances.
When, for instance, an wound has been
inflicted, or an operation necessarily performed,
on a robust person, bleeding immediately,
or very soon after it, may be
useful; because it will tend to lessen the
chance of the natural action being carried
so high as to become changed.
These people cannot have their action<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
much increased without disease; and,
therefore, it is necessary to lessen it, and
bring it down to a more proper medium.
But there are other cases, where
the action is naturally rather too low,
and the patient weakly. In these cases,
bleeding can do no good, but much
harm; because it increases the previous
weakness, and makes the inflammation,
if it does occur, more dangerous, on account
of the little power which there is
to support the action. These people even
bear bleeding worse than others, when
inflammation has actually taken place.
It ought never to be practised, in order
to reduce the natural action, before disease
has taken place; and, after the inflammatory
action is induced, it ought
to be used cautiously, and only to such
an extent, as may be necessary for removing
the tendency to immediate bad consequences.
It ought, however, to be<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
used very early in the disease; because,
in weak people, the action does more harm
in a given time, than in the strong; but
it ought likewise to be sooner abandoned,
otherwise we either hasten mortification,
or prevent the act of restoration from
taking place.</p>

<p>Bleeding is rarely necessary in inflammation
of the cellular substance alone,
unless the action be extensive; in
which case, the system is so affected, as
to require our interference. When the
cutis is inflamed, producing erysipelas,
the system suffers considerably; but, as
this frequently ends in mortification,
bleeding has been neglected by many;
but it is evident, that, if the disease be
simple, and not dependent upon any specific
agens dissimilis, or epidemic contagion,
venesection is the proper cure, provided
it be early employed, as we thus<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
diminish the action more certainly than
by any other means. If, however, the
disease have been neglected, and the action
be nearer a termination, then we
must either do nothing in the way of
general treatment, or must give opposite
remedies from bleeding, according to
circumstances. When muscles are inflamed,
bleeding is often necessary to a
very great extent, as we observe in
rheumatism; and, in the beginning, we
must take a greater quantity at a time,
in order to procure an abatement, than
in many other cases. When the viscera
are inflamed, bleeding is uniformly necessary,
and generally requires to be frequently
repeated.</p>

<p>It is a common opinion, that the
blood ought to be taken, if possible, from
a vein which arises from, or near the affected
part; that, for instance, in phrenites,<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
we should bleed in the jugular
vein; in inflammation of the feet, we
should bleed in the leg, &amp;c.: And, when
this can conveniently be done, it may be
preferred; because, it not only possesses
all the advantages of general bleeding
from any other vein, but also may be
supposed to produce, in a slight degree,
a topical evacuation. If, however, the
veins be so small, that we cannot detract
enough of blood, and sufficiently quickly;
or if, from any other cause, we cannot
do so, then, if the general action be
violent, we must have recourse to another
vein, as the loss to be sustained, by
confining ourselves to this vein, is infinitely
greater, than any good which can
be derived from it, as a local evacuation.
Indeed, when we consider the laws of the
circulation, we must allow, that very little
good can be done in this way, as a
local detraction; because one vein does<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
not lose more blood than another, except
during the moment of the flow.</p>

<p>The blood, when drawn during inflammation,
has always a buffy coat,
which is, in general, thicker, and more
concave, in proportion to the violence of
the inflammatory action; and the continuance
of this condition, is one circumstance
which points out the necessity of
continuing our evacuation: But the mere
existence of a buffy crust, is not, without
these circumstances, any infallible
sign of the necessity of bleeding; because
this crust is to be found on the blood,
after the inflammation has begun to become
passive; and it is to be found also,
when mortification is approaching; we
observe it likewise very frequently upon
the last cup of blood which we find it
necessary to take away. In these cases,
however, the crust is much softer, generally<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
thinner, always flat, instead of concave,
and looser in the texture; it is also
more of a greenish hue. These circumstances,
conjoined with the state of the
pulse, will enable us to judge, whether
we should totally desist from, or continue
our evacuations with caution. Most frequently
they forbid farther bleeding.</p>

<p>Cold, or the subduction of heat, is
chiefly useful as a topical application;
but it is also proper to be applied, in
moderation, for the abatement of the general
fever, unless we be desirous of procuring
perspiration. The quantity of
bed-clothes ought to be lessened, cold
drink should be allowed, and a free circulation
of cool air into the room. The
application of cold, however, ought, in
general, only to be carried to such an extent
as shall be sufficient for diminishing
the morbid degree of heat, and not so<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
far as to produce sensible cold, or the
sensation of cold; because this, in many
instances, will be pernicious, upon the
principle of the sympathy of equilibrium,
the action of the internal parts
being increased by the speedy application
of cold to the surface; and, therefore,
if the internal parts be inflamed,
their morbid action must be still farther
increased. If the cold be long applied,
to any considerable degree, it will likewise,
by the sympathy of association,
weaken the whole system too much, and
injure the act of restoration. As bleeding
is to be used only until it restores a
natural state, and abates pain, so also is
cold only to be applied in such a degree
as may be necessary for diminishing the
preternatural heat, and sensation of the
surface; which it does, by lessening the
morbidly increased action, and reducing
it to the natural state. The degree must<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
therefore gradually be diminished, in
proportion as the general disease subsides,
otherwise we injure the system, and prevent
recovery. There is, however, this
difference betwixt bleeding and the application
of cold, that the first may be
used suddenly, and to a considerable extent
at once, whereas, the second ought,
especially in all cases of internal inflammation,
to be employed more slowly, and
its degree regulated by the degree of the
general heat of the surface.</p>

<p>Nauseating medicines are also very
useful, independently of the sweating
which they frequently induce; and are a
very powerful mean of abating action in
<span class="nowrap">general<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span>. Employed, after bleeding has
been used once or twice, they are productive<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
of considerable benefit; but there
are some affections, in which they cannot
be used, such as inflammation of
the stomach and intestines; but in inflammation
of the lungs, of the throat,
muscles, or surface, they may often be
prescribed with benefit. The remedies
usually employed for this purpose, are,
small doses of emetics, given without
drink. It must, however, be remembered,
that these frequently produce considerable
evacuations, either from the
skin or bowels, and, therefore, may occasion
a permanent weakness. We must
likewise avoid raising the sickness to a
great degree, and keeping it long up;
because the same objection applies nearly
to this as to bleeding ad deliquium.</p>

<p>Purging is frequently employed in
the cure of inflammation, especially such
purgatives as are called cooling, which,<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
in this case, is an imaginary quality;
but, unless in so far as they tend to abate
the irritation of costiveness, they
can do no more than bleeding can, and
are, in many respects, inferior to it.
They are, in one view, to be compared
with the application of cold, which is
only indicated when there is much heat;
both are intended to diminish action,
chiefly by removing stimuli from the
part to which they are applied. Purging
is very uncertain in the effects which
it produces on the system, and in the degree
of weakness which it causes; and,
therefore, never can be put in competition
with bleeding, as a general remedy;
and, wherever bleeding is improper, or
its propriety doubtful, purgatives are still
more injurious. They operate likewise
so slowly, at least comparatively speaking,
that they do not influence the local
action so much, as the loss of such a<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
quantity of blood, as would produce an
equal effect on the body, will do, unless
in particular cases, when they act upon
the principle of the sympathy of equilibrium;
as, for instance, in pulmonic inflammation,
when they sometimes are of
service, by increasing the action of the
intestines, and diminishing that of the
<span class="nowrap">lungs<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span>. In the same way, emetics sometimes
cure slight inflammation of the
tonsils. One of the best and pleasantest saline
purgatives, is the phosphate of soda,
which may be given to an adult in the
dose of an ounce, in order to obviate the
effects of costiveness. If we wish to use
it, upon the principle of the sympathy of
equilibrium, we must give two ounces,
or more. The same cautions which were<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
given, with regard to bleeding, apply also
to purging.</p>

<p>Sweating, considered as a mean of
abating general action, is, in most cases,
inferior to bleeding; and can never,
when the general inflammatory action is
considerable, be trusted to alone; but,
after the use of the lancet, it is generally
serviceable. It is useful, in particular,
when the local disease is not confined
to a small spot, but affects a considerable
surface, or different parts of the
body; as, for instance, in the rheumatism;
but it acts, in these cases, rather
by the sympathy of equilibrium, than by
any other mode. At the same time, the
induction of a sweat, preceded by bleeding,
(which tends to abate the local action
as well as the general one) will
sometimes be useful, by giving a secretory
termination to the general disease,<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
and hastening its conclusion. In the
first point of view, sweating may be used
early in the disease, especially if preceded
by bleeding. In the second, it will be
chiefly useful toward the end, as it will
then accelerate the termination, and thus
influence the local action; for the abatement
of the general action must also produce
an abatement of the action of a
particular part. Sweating, as well as
purging, must be used with caution in
weakly people, or in those who are reduced
by disease; because, although the
action of particular parts may be increased
by it, yet, partly in consequence of
this temporary increase, and partly on
account of the fluid which is discharged,
general weakness is induced. One of
the best sudorifics is the pulvis ipecacuanhæ
comp.; of which we may give ten
grains every hour, until sweating be produced,
giving warm lemonade alongst<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
with it. The tartar emetic is also a very
useful sudorific; the sixth part of a grain
may be given every half hour, until the
proper effect be <span class="nowrap">produced<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span>.</p>

<p>Some of the agentes dissimiles may
be considered as proper remedies in this
complaint; such as, digitalis, laurel water,
lead, &amp;c.; But they are certainly inferior
to blood-letting; and have been so
little employed in this way, that their
effects are not <span class="nowrap">ascertained<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span>.</p>

<p>Bleeding, of all the general remedies,
is the best; and, next to that, cold,
and nausea, which may be considered as<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
useful adjuvants. Sweating and purging
are mostly to be used when particular
indications present themselves, as may
be understood from what has been already
said. The first of these remedies,
act chiefly by producing an universal
abatement of action; and, of these,
bleeding produces the most permanent
effect on the body, and the most certain
effect on the local disease. The two last
are perhaps more useful, upon the principle
of the sympathy of equilibrium,
than that of abating action in general,
which is only a secondary operation;
and, therefore, they may be considered
as remedies, acting rather topically than
generally; for, according to this view,
they act chiefly on the affected part.
These two kinds of remedies may, in
many cases, be usefully conjoined, producing
thus a greater effect than either
would do singly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>

<p>Before quitting this subject, it may
not be improper to attend to the proposal
which has been made, of exhibiting
anodynes immediately after bleeding, in
order to remove the pain. “The most
effectual remedy for this purpose, (says
Mr. Bell) is opium, which, when pain
and irritation are considerable, as in
extensive inflammations very frequently
happens, should never be omitted.
In large wounds, especially after amputations,
and other capital operations,
in punctures of all kinds too, large
doses of opium are always attended
with remarkably good effects. In all
such cases, however, opium, in order
to have a proper influence, should, as
we have observed, be administered in
full doses, otherwise, instead of proving
serviceable, it seems rather to have
the contrary effect; a circumstance
which is perhaps the chief reason why<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
opiates in general have been very unjustly
condemned, in every case of inflammation.”
That, in every case of
inflammation, opiates are hurtful, is what
no one can assert; and their utility will
afterwards be fully manifested. But, that
opium is useful, or even harmless, in the
inflammatio valida, which we are at present
considering, cannot be admitted;
because daily experience, independent of
every theory, proves, that, by their use,
the general fever is increased, and the
local action aggravated. Even given as
a preventative of inflammation, after operations,
anodynes are almost uniformly
<span class="nowrap">hurtful<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span>, producing restlessness, heat,<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
and thirst, and afterwards head-ache,
sickness, and frequently troublesome vomiting.
I have therefore now, after almost
every operation, laid aside their use,
and find, that the diseased <span class="nowrap">action<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>, subsequent
to the local irritation, runs its
progress with much less disturbance, and
is much milder, and shorter, than where
anodynes have been administered; and,
in general, the sleep is much more composed,
and always more refreshing. I
have therefore, after lithotomy, amputation,
the extirpation of the mammæ,<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
and after labours, in almost every instance,
omitted them.</p>

<p>The local applications are such as
tend either simply to abate action in the
part, or such as tend to change its nature,
by exciting a specific change, or
such as act in both ways. The first
comprehends cold, the second the agentes
dissimiles, and the third topical bleeding.</p>

<p>Cold, applied directly to the inflamed
part, is a most useful remedy, diminishing
the action to a natural state; but,
for this purpose, it must not be applied
in too great a degree, otherwise we diminish
the action so much, and so suddenly,
(and, consequently, the power of
the part) that recovery cannot take place.
If we apply much cold to a healthy part,
we sink its action so far, that it is irrecoverable;<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
if we apply cold to an inflamed
part, so as to diminish its action
equally suddenly, and in the same proportion,
we produce the same effect. Poultices
of ice, or snow, are therefore highly dangerous;
and even water, although it cannot
be made nearly so cold as these. The same
direction which has been given, with regard
to the application of cold as a general
remedy, ought also to be remembered,
when we use it as a local application,
namely, it ought to be carried just
to such a degree, as shall diminish the
morbid sensation, and ought to be so adjusted,
as to keep the part nearly in its
natural degree, or at least very little
lower. For this purpose, it must be applied
in moderation, repeatedly, and with
assiduity; and not, as is commonly done,
in a considerable degree at once, and renewed
only at long intervals. Cold has
been supposed to be useful as an active<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
astringent, producing a contraction in the
vessels; but it does not seem to possess
any active power in producing such a
state in the vessels to which it is applied.
Where injury is taking place, from excessive
action, cold, by abating it, may
strengthen, and produce more natural
contractions; but, when applied to a
healthy part, it diminishes the action of
that part, the blood is less forcibly circulated,
and the part shrinks; it therefore
stops active hemorrhage in the part
on which it acts. When cold is applied
suddenly, or to delicate parts, it excites
an universal action, or contraction, or
shrinking, from weakness; and, therefore,
may likewise stop hemorrhage from
distant parts. In many cases, when this
shrinking, or temporary contraction, is
suddenly induced by cold, it becomes
converted into the natural muscular contraction
of the part; thus, for instance,<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
if cold be applied to the uterus <span class="nowrap">itself<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span>,
when torpid, after delivery, we find, that,
after the first effect, or shrinking of the
vessels, a more natural contraction takes
place. If, however, cold be long applied,
we find, that the contraction thus induced
ceases, owing to the diminution of
action which is occasioned by its continuance,
and the original state of collapse,
or shrinking, alone remains.</p>

<p>Blisters likewise act by simply abating
the action of the part; but differ
from cold, in requiring to be applied,
not to the part which is affected, but to
some other, with which it exhibits the
sympathy of equilibrium; as, for instance,
to the integuments of the thorax,<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
in pulmonic inflammation; to the skin
of the knee, in affections of the joint, &amp;c.
It is, however, necessary, when a general
disease, or fever, is induced, that bleeding
be fully employed, before we have
recourse to blistering; because, if it be
not, the inflammation, excited by the
blister, co-operates to increase the fever,
alongst with the original disease, which
it has not had time to overcome, or lessen.
Blistering likewise acts more effectually,
when the local action has been already
diminished, by previous bleeding.
The size of the blister should be proportioned
to the probable extent of the diseased
action; at the same time, we must
set bounds to this magnitude; because,
if too large, they may not only produce,
or keep up a general disease, but also, by
lessening the action of the internal parts
too much, and too quickly, they may<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
prevent <span class="nowrap">recovery<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span>. It is therefore better
to apply them of a moderate size, and
renew them frequently, than to apply
one too large at once. It must, however,
be remembered, that inflammations of
every part are not equally readily overcome
in this way; and, therefore, one
will require a larger blister than another;
thus, the same quantity of inflammatory
action in the brain, will be more
difficultly subdued, than in the breast;
and, therefore, we must apply, in that
case, a larger blister. As it is the inflammatory
action, induced by the blister,
and not the discharge, as was once
supposed, which is useful, it follows, that
the same blistered place should not be
kept too long from healing, or in the<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
state of an issue, but that we ought rather
to apply a succession of blisters; and
this succession should be pretty rapid.
There is indeed one case, in which issues
are admissible, namely, where, from the
nature of the inflamed part, or the peculiarity
of the inflammation, if it be specific,
or scrophulous, the progress of the
action is very slow. In these cases, a
rapid, and continued succession of blister
would, doubtless, be most useful, but,
from the duration of the treatment,
would scarcely be submitted to: Issues,
which are less painful, and less troublesome,
are, therefore, generally preferred.
We have an instance of this in many diseased
joints.</p>

<p>The remedies which tend to diminish
the inflammatory action, by producing a
peculiar, or specific change, are, the agentes
dissimiles, of which, for this purpose,<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
lead is the best, and the one which
is most frequently employed. Lead, in
the state of an oxyde, was long ago used;
but it does not appear, in this condition,
to have much activity; and, therefore,
the saline preparations are now introduced
into use. The acetite of lead,
on account of the supposed power of vegetable
acids in abating inflammation,
has been considered as possessing a great
superiority over other forms; but its
chief recommendation over other soluble
preparations, is its cheapness; for the nitrate
of lead seems to be equally powerful.
The acetite of lead may be employed,
either before or after crystallisation; but,
if we use the crystals, they must be redissolved;
for which purpose, soft, or distilled
water, must be employed, otherwise a
decomposition takes place. The strength
of the solution which we apply, must be
determined by the natural delicacy of<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
the part, and its morbid sensibility, in
consequence of inflammation. In the inflammatio
valida, in which alone it is
proper, the solution never ought to be so
strong as to produce pain. When the
eye, urethra, and other delicate parts, are
inflamed, the application ought to be just
so strong as to produce sensation, and
should be very frequently repeated.
When the cellular substance is inflamed,
and we begin the application before the
cutis be much affected, the solution will
not require to be so strong as to produce
sensation; because, were it to be so, the
action excited might, from the quantity
required to produce the effect, be so
great, and so suddenly induced, that the
powers of recovery would be lost, or a
specific inflammation be occasioned, as
we observe, when the solution is very
much concentrated, in which case, even
sloughs are sometimes produced. On the<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
same account, we must renew the application
frequently, at least if we use
pledgets, otherwise the evaporation of
the solvent increases the strength more
than we desire. For incipient phlegmon,
we may employ a solution consisting of
three pounds of rain or river water, and
five drachms of sugar of lead; or the following,
which is more elegant:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
R.&ensp;Cerussa Acetatæ dr. iii ss.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Aceti Vini unc. iii. Solve super focum dein adde.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Aq. Distill. Frigid, lb. i ss.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Aq. Rosar. unc. iv.
</p>

<p>This may be applied by means of pledgets
of linen; or part of it may be
made into a poultice, with crum of stale
bread.</p>

<p>Saturnine poultices ought always to<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
be applied cold; because we thus receive
both the benefit of the cold, and of the
lead. The directions which have already
been given, with regard to the application
of cold, are to be attended to here.</p>

<p>Lead has been supposed to act as an
astringent; but, if astringents were useful,
alum would be more effectual than
any of the preparations of lead.</p>

<p>The vegetable acids have been considered
as sedatives, and are generally employed
in the cure of inflammation; but
it would rather seem, as if they belonged
to the class of agentes similes; for, in
moderate quantities, they increase the
appetite, &amp;c. which no sedative, or agens
dissimilis, ever <span class="nowrap">does<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span>: They also excite<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
a general action, which is different from
that induced by sedatives, and which is
useful in curing many of the actions induced
by these agents. We likewise
find, that they are not serviceable, as local
applications, in the cure of inflammation,
unless in so far as they become the
vehicle for applying cold. The surface
is not very susceptible of their action;
and, therefore, those who are inclined to
continue their use, may do so without
injury, and even with benefit, if they be
cold; but then the same benefit will be
derived from cold water.</p>

<p>Alcohol is likewise considered by some
as a sedative, and introduced as a remedy,
in the enumeration of those which are<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
applicable in <span class="nowrap">inflammation<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span>; but, whatever
its use may be in the inflammatio
debilis, it must be allowed to be evidently
hurtful in the inflammatio valida.</p>

<p>The last division of local application,
contains those which tend, both simply
to abate action in general, and also to
excite, to a certain degree, a specific
change of the action. Topical bleeding
is the chief remedy belonging to this division.
Bleeding with leeches, or the
scarificator, is employed in two different
circumstances: First, when we detract
directly from the inflamed part; as, for
instance, from the surface of a phlegmon:
Secondly, when we detract only
from the neighbourhood of the inflamed
part; for instance, from the skin
which covers an inflamed joint. When<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
we employ topical bleeding, in the first
case, we may suppose, that the aperture,
and effusion from the extremities of the
inflamed vessels, produces, to a certain
degree, a change of action. Every action
of the vessels is performed at their
extremities, and the trunks and branches
may be considered as canals subservient
to the extremities, and which contract
and dilate, in a degree proportioned to
the general and local action. If, during
health, we open a number of the extremities
of these vessels, we induce the hemorrhagic
action, which continues longer
or shorter, according to circumstances,
and which gradually terminates in a serous
discharge, or secretion. If, during
inflammation, we open a number of the
extremities of vessels, either in the inflamed
part, or immediately contiguous
to it, we induce a similar hemorrhagic action,
which is different from the inflammatory<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
one, and, therefore, tends to diminish
that action in the part. We likewise,
by inducing the serous secretion,
tend to produce a termination to the inflammatory
action.</p>

<p>Topical bleeding will also, in part,
operate, by simply abating the action, in
consequence of the mere loss of blood;
for, as the blood is withdrawn immediately,
by different orifices, from the
vessels of one part, that part, and those
near it, may be supposed to suffer sooner,
and to a greater degree, than the rest of
the system. The branches which yield
the blood, will even suffer considerably,
for a time, although the loss of blood be
very trifling, and produce no effect on
the system. Thus, if one small artery be
divided, we find, that, although the
quantity of blood which flows from it
be very inconsiderable, yet it is sufficient<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
to produce evident changes in that vessel,
making it contract, and become smaller,
although the vessels in other parts be not
at all affected. This depends upon the
<span class="nowrap">peculiar<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> action of the individual artery
being <span class="nowrap">affected<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span>, and the contracting
state of the orifice, spreading along the
branch and trunk by <span class="nowrap">degrees<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span>, by<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
which less blood is made to circulate
through it. Bleeding from a vein, however,
has not the same effect; because the
quantity of blood in a part, is not so immediately
dependent upon the state of
the veins; and because veins are not the
seat of much action. When we divide a
small vein, we find, that it, by degrees,
contracts, and transmits less blood, or
closes completely; but the blood from
the part does not circulate faster, nor is
less blood sent to that part than formerly;
therefore, topical bleeding from<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
veins near the affected part, can have no
great superiority over general bleeding.</p>

<p>The division, then, of a number of
small arteries, may cure inflammation in
two ways; first, by inducing a different
action; secondly, by possessing the general
properties of bleeding, namely, a
simple diminution of action. The first
will operate chiefly, when we apply the
leeches on part of the inflamed portion.
The second will operate, when we detract
only from the immediate vicinity; and,
in this case, the quantity of blood which
is taken away, must be greater; because
the effect has to be extended some way,
the vessels not being in the inflamed
part. The quantity must likewise be
greater, because the effect depends entirely
upon this; whereas, in the other
case, it depended, in part, upon the peculiarity<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
of the action which was produced.</p>

<p>The number of leeches which it is necessary
to apply, will depend upon the
violence of the action, and the place on
which they are set; for, the greater the
distance from the inflamed part, the
more numerous ought they to be. It is
therefore impossible to give any particular
rule for the extent of topical bleeding.
It may, however, be proper to observe,
that we ought not to be satisfied
with one application, more than with
one venesection, for a general disease, but
ought to repeat the local bleeding, whenever
it may be necessary, although it
may be twice or thrice in a day, founding
our indications upon the same principle
on which we use general bleeding.
It is by a too sparing application of
leeches, and their not being repeated sufficiently<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
frequently, that we so often fail
in removing inflammations, which, by a
more active treatment, we might resolve.
In general, the leeches ought to be applied
as near the affected part as possible,
or upon it. If, however, the seat of the
inflammation be chiefly in the cutis, as
in erysipelas, it will perhaps be more
prudent not to apply them upon the
spot; because the subsequent irritation is
apt to increase the action afterwards, on
account of the great delicacy of the part.
There may even be some doubt as to the
propriety of applying leeches to the vicinity
of the inflammation; for the irritation
of the bites may produce erysipelas in
the part, or cause the original disease to
spread.</p>

<p>The scarificator may be used where
leeches cannot be obtained; but it is not
so useful, when applied to the inflamed<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
part, on account of the irritation which
attends its application, and the cupping;
but it is equally proper, where we detract
not from the part itself, but from
its vicinity.</p>

<p>Of the topical remedies, bleeding is
the most powerful; and, next to that,
cold solutions of lead. Where these cannot
be employed, owing to the internal
situation of the inflamed part, blisters
must be used in their place.</p>

<p>Many other remedies used to be recommended,
under the name of discutients,
repellants, &amp;c.; some of which
have been formerly mentioned, when
considering the ancient theories of inflammation;
these, however, are now
laid aside. But many practitioners still
have an idea, that benefit will be derived
from mechanically softening the parts by<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
means of oils, or what they call emollients;
and seem to consider, that poultices
are chiefly useful for the same purpose;
at least they only direct, that they
shall be removed before they turn “stiff
or hard.” But inflammation must be
attributed to a different cause than increased
attrition, and its cure must be
effected by different agents from those
which we employ for softening a piece
of dead skin. Oils and liniments, in so
far as they form a basis for other applications,
or are used alongst with gentle
friction, may be occasionally proper in
the inflammatio assuefacta; but, in the
inflammatio valida, they must be considered
as absolutely useless.</p>

<p>There are also some remedies, recommended
with the intention of absorbing
acrimonious excretions; such as, flour
or magnesia, in erysipelas. But these<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
seem to act entirely by allowing the action
to run its course, without interruption,
affording a softer defence than could
otherwise be obtained. From the quick
progress of violent cuticular inflammation,
the applications which are usually
made in other inflammations have been
forbid here, and are said to be pernicious;
but this rather appears to arise
from the application not being properly
timed, than from any peculiarity in the
disease. It is not easy to give any good
reason why cold saturnine solution, of a
proper <span class="nowrap">weakness<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span>, and sufficiently early<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
applied, should not be useful; nor do we
find, that they are in reality hurtful in
simple erythema. Where this, however,
attends wounds, or is not an original
disease, these are improper; because it is
in general, in these cases, an attendant
upon the inflammatio debilis, or a symptom
of it, and requires either to be let
alone, or to have stimulating applications
made to it, at the same time that we give
bark <span class="nowrap">internally<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span>.</p>

<p>These remarks upon the resolution of
the inflammatio valida, may be concluded,
by observing, that the diet ought to
be low and sparing, in a degree proportioned
to the violence of the action.<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
Such motion as affects the local action,
must at all times be prevented; but when
a general action likewise exists, then general
quietude must also be insisted on.</p>


<h3><i>Of the Remedies which are necessary for inducing
Suppuration.</i></h3>

<p>Suppuration is a new action, the
exciting cause of which is inflammation;
but, that it may take place, it is requisite,
that the inflammatory action be
prevented from subsiding too soon, or too
suddenly; in which case, either resolution,
or inflammatio assuefacta, takes
place: Whilst, on the other hand, we
must prevent the action from rising too
high, and proceeding too rapidly; in
which case, mortification is caused.</p>

<p>In these cases, in which resolution<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
cannot be obtained, suppuration will generally
take place, without any interference
on our part, provided we prevent
the action from terminating in gangrene.
This we observe in many internal inflammations.
At the same time, we
may sometimes accelerate this process,
by a proper regulation of the original
action.</p>

<p>The remedies proper for moderating
and removing the inflammatory action,
have been already mentioned; but these
sometimes fail to produce resolution; in
which case, either suppuration, or mortification,
take place. When the symptoms
of suppuration take place (which
have been already noticed), all that is
perhaps essentially necessary, is, to give
up the resolving plan, and not interrupt
the natural progress of the action. If,
however, the inflammatory action continue<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
longer stationary, and seem neither
to be resolving, nor decidedly inducing
the suppurative action, then such
remedies as increase the action, and accelerate
its progress, are essentially requisite.
These remedies, however, are, in
general, indiscriminately applied in both
cases.</p>

<p>For the purpose of inducing, or accelerating
the suppurative action, it was
formerly the practice to apply liniments,
cataplasms, and fomentations, composed
of stimulating substances, such as garlic,
turpentine, galbanum, &amp;c.; but of late
these have been almost entirely abandoned.
Heat and electricity have the
property of increasing the performance of
every action which is existing at the
time of their application, and, therefore,
are the remedies chiefly to be employed
in the present instance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span></p>

<p>Heat may be applied in two ways,
with or without moisture. In the first,
it increases action more suddenly, and
perhaps more simply. In the second, its
effects are more gradual, and are likewise
complicated with those of moisture, which
certainly is an agent capable of operating
on the living system, and generally tends
to excite a secretory action, or to give a
secretory termination to those increased
actions, which are induced by agents
operating alongst with it. Dry heat is
therefore evidently improper in the inflammatio
valida, because it will tend to
produce mortification; but, if moisture
be conjoined, then the suppurative action
is excited. When, however, the action
has made an approach to the inflammatio
assuefacta, then it may be useful to raise
the action simply by dry heat, for a little,
before we apply heat and moisture;
because, if we apply moisture at first, the<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
progress is more tedious, and the action
is less certainly <span class="nowrap">excited<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span>. Electricity is
similar in its operation to heat and dryness,
and may be usefully employed in
similar cases; but we must, if we expect
any benefit, repeat its operation frequently,
and continue each application for a
considerable <span class="nowrap">time<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span>.</p>

<p>There are two forms in which we
employ heat and moisture, namely, fomentations<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
and poultices. <span class="nowrap">Fomentations<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span>
have this superiority over poultices, that
the same degree of heat is always kept
up during their application; whereas,
when we use poultices, the heat subsides,
as they are renewed only at considerable
intervals; but fomentations require longer
attendance, and more trouble; and, therefore,
are only employed for a short time,
and commonly betwixt the intervals at
renewing the poultices.</p>

<p>Poultices are generally made of
bread and milk boiled together, so as to
form a thick kind of paste, to which is
added, so much olive oil as will preserve<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
it from hardening <span class="nowrap">quickly<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span>. These
ought to be applied, either of the same
temperature with the inflamed part, or
hotter, according to circumstances. When
the inflammation seems to be naturally
and quickly tending toward suppuration,
it is, as has been already mentioned, by
no means essential, that any application
be made externally, in order to induce
the suppurative <span class="nowrap">action<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span>; but still poultices
are used, and, in many cases, accelerate
the progress. In this case, the<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
poultices should only be applied so hot
as not to give any considerable sensation
of heat, otherwise we increase the action
too much, and too rapidly, and, if early
employed, may even interrupt, or stop the
incipient purulent action, renewing the
inflammation, and perhaps making it terminate
in partial gangrene. Poultices,
then, should not be applied very hot at
first, especially when the action seems to
be such as to make us expect that it shall
run its course without any assistance.
But when the inflammatory action has
been more tedious, and does not terminate
in the suppurative one so soon, and
so decidedly as we would wish, then
poultices must be applied, with a different<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
intention, being meant, not solely
to prevent the action from sinking,
as in the first case, but also to raise it,
and make it brisker. The heat must
therefore be greater, and such as to give
a considerable sensation; and the poultices,
instead of being changed only when
they begin to grow <span class="nowrap">hard<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span>, which is perhaps
all that is necessary in the first case,
must be renewed very frequently, in order
to keep up the increased degree of heat,
or the agent which supports the action,
and accelerates its progress. They ought,
in this case, to be taken off and warmed,
or renewed almost every hour, at least
when the action is tedious, that is to say,
when they are most required. We are
then not to lay down any certain degree<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
of heat which is to be employed, nor fix
any particular number of times at which
the poultices must, in every instance, be
changed, but regulate our practice entirely
by the nature of each particular instance,
taking the progress and degree of
the action as our guide, in this respect,
and interfering exactly in proportion to
the necessity for interference. It may
not, however, be improper to remark,
that, cæteris paribus, the heat must be
greater in proportion to the depth of the
inflamed part below the skin; or, in
other words, we must apply more heat,
when we are obliged to act on a part not
yet inflamed, than when we act directly
on the inflamed part itself. When an
abscess forms at a distance from the surface,
the parts betwixt it and the surface
gradually come, as was formerly mentioned,
to assume the purulent action;
and the sympathy of equilibrium, which<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
naturally exists betwixt the surface and
the parts below, gives way to the sympathy
of <span class="nowrap">association<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span>, the parts coming,
by degrees, to perform one uniform action
together, which spreads from within<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
to without. When we apply heat to the
surface, at this place, we, by continuance,
likewise induce the sympathy of association,
and the increased action spreads and
operates on the disease; but there is this
difference, that the action of the heat
spreads from without to within, and thus
accelerates the progress of the suppurative
action.</p>

<p>When the suppurative action has existed
a certain time, we find, that it gradually
extends itself to the skin, purulent
matter being formed, instead of organic
particles; on which account, the
cavity enlarges, and the covering becomes
daily thinner. At last, the action
reaches even to the cutis, which becomes
white and flaccid, first at a point, and
then to a greater <span class="nowrap">extent<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span>. When this<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
happens, the thin covering is either torn
by the pressure of the contained fluid,
acted on by the surrounding parts, or
acting by its own weight; or, if this
does not take place, the suppurative action
still proceeds going through the cutis,
the organisation of which, like that
of the parts below, is lost: The thin cuticle
now rises up into a little blister, and
then gives way. The matter runs gradually
out, the sides collapse, and come
nearer by degrees to each other, at the
same time that the ulcerative action succeeds
to the suppurative. The quantity
of the discharge, therefore, daily lessens;
the internal surface, or sides of the abscess,
come in contact; and the granulations<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
at the margin or circumference
unite; those belonging to one side uniting
with those of the other, and thus
producing recovery by successive circles
of reunion, which form rapidly, or more
slowly, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>Such is the natural progress of an abscess;
but it has been proposed, that it
ought not to be allowed to follow this,
but ought to be opened before it bursts
spontaneously; and this opening has generally
been desired to be pretty large,
chiefly perhaps on the principle of allowing
a free evacuation of the matter.
Where abscesses are seated over cavities
into which they may <span class="nowrap">burst<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span>, instead of
opening externally, there can be no doubt
of the necessity of making an early evacuation;<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
and, in these cases, we ought
to open them before the skin becomes
white; or, in other words, before the action
reaches the surface; because, if the
abscess be seated equally betwixt the skin
and the cavity below, we may suppose,
that, if it be extending itself in all directions,
or toward the <span class="nowrap">cavity<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span>, in the
same proportion as outwardly, that the<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
parts below will become almost irreparably
diseased before it can reach the surface,
and will give way <span class="nowrap">afterwards<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span>,
even although an opening be made externally.
Where, from the confinement
of the matter, it seems to be spreading,
or diffusing itself, by its gravity, through
the cellular substance, or among the muscles,
it will likewise be necessary to open
the abscess early; but, in this case, the
abscess is unhealthy; for, were it otherwise,
the matter would be confined by
the circle of diseased organic matter
thrown out during the inflammatory action,
and which is only removed gradually.
In this case, the suppurative action
has extended itself laterally, and perhaps<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
downward, more quickly than in health,
and has not observed the same ratio,
with regard to the extension toward the
surface; the action, therefore, reaches
parts which were not formerly inflamed
(by the sympathia consociationis serpens),
before the surface gives way; and, therefore,
the matter spreads or diffuses itself;
for, by the spreading of the action, the
confining barrier is removed, and the
matter mechanically extends itself. This
is an unhealthy abscess, and the action is
of the phagedenic nature. Opening the
abscess will not always stop this morbid
action; but, by removing the matter, it
will lessen the chance of diffusion. We
must, however, continue the free evacuation,
and place the member in a proper
posture; because, if the action continue,
the matter which still is formed will
lodge, and form sinuses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span></p>

<p>In healthy abscesses, where we do not
apprehend any detriment to the neighbouring
parts, the question comes to be,
whether opening them will accelerate the
cure? Perhaps much of the diversity of
opinion on this subject, has arisen from
not attending to the condition of the abscess
which we have been managing, and
thus we apply the prognosis and treatment
of one kind of abscess to different ones.
When an abscess has been formed slowly,
and runs its course rather tediously, we
may suppose, that the action shall continue
for a considerable time without being converted
into the ulcerative one; and, therefore,
the abscess shall remain long without
healing. In this case, a free incision,
or the irritation of a foreign body, may excite
the ulcerative action, and thus accelerate
the cure; for these abscesses have
come to approach toward the nature of
common encysted tumors, and require<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
the same treatment. But, where abscesses
are running their progress with due celerity,
and the action is proceeding
through its proper course, there is not
the same cause for interference. If, in
this case, we open them before the action
has gained the surface, we derive no benefit;
because the action still proceeds,
and the same events and circumstances
take place as if we had allowed it to
burst. If we make a large aperture, when
the abscess is ready to burst, we, by the
irritation, interfere with the process
which was going on, and delay the cure.
The admission of the air to the abscess,
owing to the free exposure, is one cause
of this delay; for it changes the nature
of the purulent action, and, if the ulcerative
action takes place, frequently renders
it unhealthy; the consequence of which,
if the abscess be large, or situated in vital
parts, is hectic. We likewise, in large<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
abscesses, by the sudden evacuation of the
matter, and removal of the distension,
sink the action of the parts, and make
covery more <span class="nowrap">tedious<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span>. When the abscess,
then, is healthy, and the action strong, it
will be more proper to allow it to follow
its natural course, and burst spontaneously,
than open it, by a large incision,
or by the introduction of a seton: If we
do open it, the orifice should not at first
be large, but should just comprehend the
diseased or whitened surface.</p>

<p>Sometimes, after an abscess has burst,
or been opened, it continues in a progressive
state of amendment for some
time, and then becomes stationary, continuing
to discharge matter without healing.<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
This either takes place from the
whole surface, or from a particular part
of it, forming a sinus, the treatment of
which will afterwards be mentioned, being
the same with those which succeed
abscesses which are originally unhealthy.</p>

<p>After an abscess bursts, the proper
application is a warm <span class="nowrap">poultice<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span>, which
should be continued in general as long
as there is any stool, or hard margin;
that is to say, until the increased quantity
of diseased organic particles, which
were formed during the inflammation,
be absorbed, and the vessels at that part
have either assumed the suppurative or
natural action. After this, the orifice
ought to be covered with a slip of lint,
and moderate pressure applied over the<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
surface of the <span class="nowrap">abscess<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span>, by which the
sides are kept in constant contact, and reunion
is accelerated. Good diet is also
necessary, for we thus increase the powers
of recovery, or keep up a proper action,
and renew the vital principle, the quantity
of which has been lessened during
the inflammation, both by the continuance
of a state of overaction, and by the
remedies which are employed to diminish
the action; for a state of real and permanent
weakness is thus induced.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, that suppuration
takes place very slowly, and the action
seems to be performed with little
vigour. In this case, if the abscess be
allowed to burst of itself, we both lose
time, and are often, in the end, disappointed<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
in a cure, the healing process not
taking place. It is therefore useful, in
these cases, to have recourse to other agents
besides heat. If the pain be trifling,
and the suppuration be what may
be called chronic, or approaching to it,
we will perhaps succeed, by applying
gentle pressure on the abscess, by means
of a thin roller, and laying a warm poultice
over this. But, when this fails to
increase the action, we ought to pass a
seton, by which we evacuate the matter,
and keep up the subsequent action to a
degree sufficient for producing recovery.
In doing this, however, it is necessary to
attend to the state of the tumor; because,
if, in every instance, we pass it from the
highest to the lowest part, we shall sometimes
make the part give way in a third
place. If, for instance, the abscess be
much thinner at the apex than elsewhere,
or, if the action have made considerable<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
progress toward the surface, then the stimulus
of the action increases the performance
of the natural process which was
going on, and the action continues to extend
itself until the part gives way. In
these cases, then, we ought to pass the
seton from the thin part to the lowest
part; and this, in general, will, from the
sympathy of association, be sufficient to
excite the action of the whole internal
surface.</p>

<p>When we resolve to use the seton, the
following is the easiest method of introducing
it: Make a puncture with a lancet
either into the upper, or the thinnest,
and most prominent part of the tumor, according
to circumstances; and, into this
puncture, introduce, using the lancet as
a directer, a probe, having a piece of tape
passed through its eye. The lancet is
then to be withdrawn, and the probe<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
pushed down to the under part of the
abscess, where its point will be felt under
the skin. A small incision is here to be
made upon the knob of the probe, which
is next to be passed through, and the
tape drawn after it. The matter is then
to be slowly pressed out; the tape is to
be folded; and the abscess bound up
with a compress and roller, so as to make
moderate pressure upon it. Next day,
the dressings are to be removed, and a
clean piece of the tape drawn through,
after which, pressure is again to be applied.</p>

<p>The size of the tape, the time which
the seton ought to be employed, and the
degree of pressure to be used, must be
regulated by backwardness of the action,
and the imperfection of the healing process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span></p>

<p>If, either from improper management,
or the morbid condition of the action,
the abscess, after it bursts spontaneously,
or is opened by art, continue to suppurate,
without undergoing the ulcerative
action preparatory to healing, then we
find, that either the sides remain quite
separate, producing a cavity, extended
more or less, or one particular portion
remains open, forming a sinus. Both of
these cases require a treatment, which,
in its principle, is the same, namely, the
indication of the ulcerative action.</p>

<p>In the first <span class="nowrap">case<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span>, we shall frequently
succeed by means of the seton, especially
if we use pressure alongst with it; for,<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
by keeping the internal surface in close
contact, we tend to check the purulent,
or suppurative action, and produce organic
<span class="nowrap">particles<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span>. We may also succeed,
by using stimulating injections, of such a
strength as to produce a moderate degree
of smarting. Of this kind are, wine and
water, solutions of white vitriol, corrosive
sublimate, &amp;c. These ought to be used
frequently in the course of the day, and
pressure employed during the intervals.
Incision, or laying the part open, is, being
the most severe, the last remedy which
is to be had recourse to. Small chronic
abscesses may be laid open during their
whole diameter; but larger ones require
only to be cut up for a certain length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span></p>

<p>The second case, has generally been
considered as a species of ulcer, and has
been named the sinus ulcer; but, although
the orifice may sometimes possess
the diseased ulcerative action, yet the sinus
itself still continues in the suppurative
state, and, therefore, cannot heal.
These sinuses depend, in different instances,
upon very different causes, and,
therefore, require a variation in the treatment.
The most simple species of sinus
may be called mechanical, and is produced
by matter flowing from a neighbouring
cavity, and which cannot be
freely discharged: Thus, for instance, if
a deep abscess open at the highest part,
or at a point above the level of its bottom,
the matter constantly oozes out, and
keeps the canal open. This is most apt
to occur, when abscesses are formed deep
amongst muscular parts; in which case,
although the matter point at the centre,<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
yet an accumulation must take place below,
and the matter must continue to be
discharged by the aperture, when it becomes
so abundant as to be raised to the
level of the opening; or, being once
raised, it continues to flow out. The
cure of this may at first be attempted
mechanically, by tight bandages, which
press out the matter, and keep the sides
in contact; but, if the disease have been
of long duration, then, whatever may
have been its nature at first, we find,
that the suppurative action extends along
the mechanical sinus, which then becomes
affected with a chronic action; in
which case, it becomes similar to the second
species of sinus. We must, in this
species, make an opening at the most dependent
part, and employ the means
which will be now mentioned in considering
the second species, or that produced
in consequence of the suppurative<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
action becoming chronic or habitual, independent
of any mechanical cause. This
may take place, although the aperture
have been originally in a proper place, and
the matter, instead of being retained and
keeping up the disease, shall have been regularly
discharged. The case in which
this is most likely to happen, is that in
which the abscess has been very tedious
in its progress, and the action has been,
from the first, slow. The distinction betwixt
this species, and those which remain
to be mentioned, is founded upon the absence
of the symptoms which they possess,
and by our examination with the probe,
which points out the cause and extent,
and informs us whether we be near a
bone. The orifice is flabby, and has the
appearance of the indolent ulcer. The
cure of these sinuses is to be attempted, by
pressing out the matter by means of proper
bandages, or by making a dependent
opening, which is generally necessary, at<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
the same time that we raise the action of
the part to a proper degree, and render the
suppurative action acute and vigorous; in
which case, it naturally terminates in the
ulcerative, and thus the part has its structure
restored. This is most easily effected,
by passing a seton, and applying a proper
degree of pressure, diminishing the size
of the seton gradually, and in proportion
to the vigour of the action and the approximation
toward health. When, from
the situation of the sinus, we cannot pass
a seton (which rarely happens in this species
of sinus), injections of wine may be
used frequently, and pressure applied
during the intervals. When these means
fail, which is seldom the case, the part
should, if its structure permit, be laid
open. If this sinus have remained long
open, its surface, like that of the chronic
abscess, becomes changed, and a coat is
formed, like the cyst of a tumour. When<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
this is thick and hard, the sinus has been
called a fistula, and it has been deemed
necessary to dissect out the tube; but it
is in general sufficient to use the remedies
which increase the vigour of the action,
and make it run its natural progress;
such as the seton, or a free incision,
if the parts be superficial, or no considerable
vessel or nerve runs the risk of
being wounded.</p>

<p>The third species of sinus is that in
which the suppurative action is kept up
by the operation of some adventitious
cause; such as a caries bone, diseased
cartilage, or the lodgement of a foreign
body; as, for instance, a ball, a splinter
of wood, bit of cloth, &amp;c. This species
is distinguished by our feeling the extraneous
body, or diseased bone, with the
probe, and by the fungous protuberance,
or papilla, which shoots out from the<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
orifice. In addition to the method of
curing other sinuses, we must here endeavour
to remove the adventitious cause,
which is generally very difficult to be
done. If the foreign body be deep, or if
the diseased bone lie deep, and the sinus
be narrow, we can do little in this way;
sometimes, indeed, by enlarging the external
part, we can come at the foreign
body with a pair of small forceps, and
may extract it, or may accelerate the exfoliation
of the diseased bone; but we
can have no certainty of success. If,
however, the sinus be superficial, which
sometimes happens in caries of the tibia,
&amp;c. it ought, in every instance,
to be fully laid open, and the bone exposed,
and treated in the way immediately
to be mentioned. When this cannot
be done, we may sometimes, by conveying
the proper remedies through a
tube down to the bone, procure exfoliation;<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
or may, by setons, injections, and
pressure, procure a temporary cure; but,
as long as the adventitious cause remains,
we cannot expect a permanent recovery.
It is observed, that sinuses, when they
can be healed in these circumstances,
break out again upon very trifling exertions,
and very frequently are renewed,
after a short interval, in spite of all our
precautions; such as rest, warmth, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A <span class="nowrap">caries<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> of the bone is at all times
a disease which is difficult to manage,
both on account of the mechanical obstacles<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
which we have to overcome, and
the slowness with which the affected parts
perform their actions either of disease or
recovery. The divisions of this disease
have generally been taken from the appearance
of the caries, and its extent.
We have the dry caries, the worm-eaten
caries, the spongy, or carnous caries, &amp;c.
and we have the deep and superficial.
But, as the cure of these is to be conducted
on the same principles in all of
them, and as they are most probably different
degrees of the same complaint, it
will be more useful to divide them into
those which affect bones lying deeply,
and those which affect the more superficial
bones; because these different cases
are attended with very different circumstances
and symptoms. The first is preceded
by an abscess, which forms generally
with much pain, runs its course slowly,
and does not burst for a considerable time.<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
When it does open, its sides do not ulcerate,
at least universally, but a sinus
remains, the mouth, or exposed part of
which only, assumes the ulcerative action.
The second is more rarely preceded
by any abscess, but is either coeval
with the ulcer of soft parts, (both being
produced by mechanical violence) or it
succeeds the ulcer, and is caused by it.
This ulcer belongs to the third genus,
and will be afterwards described.</p>

<p>In treating of the cure of caries, the
first thing is, to determine by what
means the disease of the bone may be
removed; and, secondly, what modification
our treatment must undergo, in consequence
of the caries belonging to the
first or second species. From the very
earliest periods, we find the application
of stimulating and corrosive remedies recommended
in this disease. The actual<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
cautery, euphorbium, mineral acids, scalding
oil, the essential oils, and warm balsams,
have been universally employed,
and frequently alternated with rasping
and perforating the bone. This proceeded
from observing, that, on the one hand,
mild applications had no effect, and, on
the other, that the natural slowness of exfoliation
was overcome by the use of these
more powerful remedies. A caries of a
bone is correspondent to a mortification
of a soft part; and, therefore, it is impossible
to restore the diseased part to health,
or life. Our chief object, then, must be
to prevent the disease from spreading,
and to procure a speedy separation of the
dead portion. The first is much less under
our power than the second; for, it is
most probable, that, in the majority of
instances, at least of those of a simple nature,
the disease, from the first, extends
a certain length, affecting a portion of<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
the bone, and that it afterwards makes
very little progress. There is, however,
a specific disease which affects the bone
in common with the soft parts. The
bone becomes rough, and suppurates;
and the soft parts have a fiery appearance:
This has been called the phagedenic
caries. Cancer, scrophula, lues, and
other specific actions, also spread after
they are once induced. The second object
is to be effected by such means as
operate upon the vitality and action of
the part, and those which act mechanically.
Those which tend mechanically
to remove the dead portion, are perforations
down to the sound part, which we
know has happened, by the bleeding
which ensues; or, we may saw down
this length with a trephine. We thus,
by cutting off the communication of part
of the diseased surface with the adjacent
parts, kill it completely, sooner than<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
could otherwise happen, and likewise stimulate
the parts below to assume the ulcerative
action, and throw it off. We
may also sometimes be able to turn out
these portions with a levator. Those
which act more exclusively, by affecting
the action of the part, are stimulating applications;
such as heat, acids, &amp;c. The
actual cautery is so terrifying to the patient,
that it is now laid aside; and it is
likewise liable to this objection, that it
may, by its operation on the neighbouring
parts of the bone, produce disease in
them. The potential cautery is more
useful, and may frequently be employed
with advantage, either in a solid form, as
to callus, &amp;c. or dissolved in water, and
applied with a <span class="nowrap">pencil<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>. M. Sue, in his<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
notes to Ravaton’s Practique, &amp;c. recommends
l’eau mercurielle, or solution of
mercury, in nitrous acid. By these means,
the sound part below assumes the ulcerative
action, its connection with the diseased
portion is then destroyed, and reparation
takes place. The ulcer of the
bone is red, and its surface covered with
innumerable granulations, which rise up
to the level of the surrounding parts, after
which a cicatrice is formed. These
granulations in the bone are absorbed,
and others more perfect are deposited in
their place, until at last they become
completely <span class="nowrap">osseous<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span></p>

<p>The next point which merits our attention,
is the situation of the bone, and
the circumstances which attend the caries.
When superficial, a fungous ulcer
is produced, and the modification which
this situation requires in the application
of the general plan will come afterwards
to be attended to; the modification in
the treatment which is required in sinuses
has been mentioned above. It may
here only be remarked, that, where the
sinuses are superficial, they may be laid
open, which will induce the ulcerative<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
action in their course, and allow us to
apply the proper remedies to the bone;
but where they run deep, we must either
allow the disease to run its natural progress,
and treat the constitution according
to the effects produced, or, by means
of a canula, convey a piece of caustic to
the diseased part, in the same way as we
treat obstinate strictures of the urethra,
&amp;c. When, with the probe, we feel the
bone loose, we may assist its exit with
the forceps, or by enlarging part of the
sinus, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>When these sinuses communicate with
joints, and depend upon diseased cartilages,
tendons, or articulating surfaces of
the bones, we can do very little in the
way of curing them by injections or incisions;
because we cannot thus remove
the disease of the joint, but may increase
it. Issues placed over the joint, with<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
rest, cleanliness, and good diet, country
air, &amp;c. are the remedies chiefly to be
employed in these cases; or, if hectic
be induced, and these remedies fail, we
must remove the diseased part, if this,
on account of its situation, be practicable.
When, however, these sinuses are
superficial, and depend upon tendons not
immediately connected with the articulation,
it may be useful to lay them
open, and treat the disease of the tendons
with caustic, like a caries of a bone,
or with escharotics, and stimulating applications.</p>

<p>The fourth species of sinuses, are those
where a specific action <span class="nowrap">exists<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span>, and prevents
the healthy ulcerative action from forming.
Of this kind is the scrophulous sinus,
which is generally accompanied with a<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
caries bone, or diseased cartilage, and,
therefore, is a complicated <span class="nowrap">sinus<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span>. This
is distinguished, where the bone is diseased,
by a shining or polished red skin,
like a cicatrix, surrounding the fungus
papilla at the orifice of the sinus, or
the scrophulous-looking sore which exists
there. When no caries bone exists, we
have no papilla, but only the diseased
ulcer at the orifice. In both cases, there
are generally the marks of a scrophulous
habit. In the first case, we are to treat
the sinus as if it were of the third species.
In the second case, we are to treat
it as if of the second, conjoining the proper
remedies internally, as will be mentioned
in considering the cure of scrophulous
action. These sinuses, although<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
healed, have a tendency to break out
again, especially in the spring or summer.</p>

<p>The effects of the suppurative action
upon the constitution, may be divided
into those which are dependent upon the
formation of the action, such as coldness,
listlessness, &amp;c. which are common to all
new actions; and those which are peculiar
to the action when fully formed.
The first set requires no particular treatment,
with an immediate reference to
their removal; but their presence indicates
the necessity of changing our method
of cure, if we have not already done
so. In conjunction with proper local applications,
we must give light nourishing
diet, with or without wine, according
to the extent of the action and the
weakness of the patient. Rest, and general
warmth, are also necessary; but<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
the heat ought not to be carried so far
as to produce any considerable sensation,
or sweating. Diaphoretics have been <span class="nowrap">recommended<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span>;
but there does not appear
to be any necessity for their exhibition;
because the cold, and other symptoms
which we intend to relieve, depend upon
the state of the local action, and are only
to be removed by fully forming this action.
Heat will not cure this coldness, or shivering,
when the action which causes it
is extensive; but, on the contrary, will
frequently increase it, by accelerating the
formative process. The immediate effects,
then, or the primary symptoms of
suppuration, require no particular treatment,
with a view to their own removal,<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
but are to be attended to as marks which
point out the necessity of a change of
treatment, with a view to keep up the
action which induces them, and to prevent
it from producing bad consequences
afterwards to the constitution. Sometimes,
indeed, in delicate people, suppuration
at this period produces hysterical
symptoms, such as languor, flatulence, or
sometimes starting, tremors, and hysteric
paroxysms, more or less distinct. The
slighter affections of this kind may be
frequently removed by a little warm
wine and water; the more severe, by anodynes,
conjoined with aromatic waters.</p>

<p>The second set of symptoms, or effects,
are those which have been already
described under the name of hectic, the
production of which has formerly been
explained. This action, when slight, has
been called weakness, and has been considered<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
as dependent upon the quantity
of the discharge; but, for the reasons
formerly mentioned, this cannot be admitted.
The cure of this state is to be
attempted, by lessening the local action,
at the same time that we give soups, and
other articles of nourishing diet, with a
moderate proportion of wine, if this
do not quicken the pulse, and produce
heat of the skin. Anodynes in the evening,
by procuring rest, will also be useful;
but none of these remedies will produce
their proper effect, unless the patient
respire a pure air. Bark is considered
as useful in these cases; but, unless
good diet be conjoined, it is not of
much benefit. If, however, we give the
means of increasing the quantity of vital
power, bark, by inducing an action more
nearly resembling the natural one, will
be serviceable; but, for this purpose, it
must be exhibited in full doses. It is<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
from giving this medicine too sparingly,
and in cases where other causes, tending
to counteract its effects, such as poor
diet, bad air, &amp;c. are allowed to remain
and operate, that bark has been brought
into disrepute.</p>

<p>When the general action is very considerable,
then the exquisite hectic is induced,
and the situation of the patient
becomes alarming. When the local action
is simply the suppurative or ulcerative
action, we may consider that the general
disease is also simple, and are to attempt
the cure by the remedies which have
been just now mentioned. In conjunction
with such local applications as tend to
check the local action, we must have recourse
to all those means which tend to
strengthen or renew the natural action of
the system in general; for which purpose,
we must attend, in the first place,<span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
to all the particular functions, or individual
parts; and, in the second, to the
whole in the aggregate. Under the second
head are included bark and wine,
with moderate <span class="nowrap">exercise<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span>, and proper
diet; in the choice of which, we must be
directed by the nourishment which is
yielded, and by the capability of digesting
the articles which we employ. In
general, milk, soups, and jellies, answer
best. Under the first head are included
such remedies as tend to promote digestion,
such as steel, bitters, mineral acids,
&amp;c. although in general the bark will
supersede their use. The state of the
bowels must also be attended to, avoiding
costiveness on the one hand, and diarrhœa<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
on the other. The secretion of
the skin must also be regulated, stopping
the colliquative sweating, if possible,
by getting up for some time when it
<span class="nowrap">commences<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span>. Lessening the quantity of
bed-clothes, for a few minutes, will also
sometimes interrupt it; but when it has
continued long, it can only be checked
by removing the diseased <span class="nowrap">action<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span>. A
full dose of the bark given before the
accession of the sweat, may sometimes,
by influencing the morbid action, prevent
the discharge. The respiration must
in particular be attended to; for, by
breathing country and pure air, the action
of respiration is more fully performed,
and, consequently, the source of vitality<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
is increased, and the effects of our
other remedies are increased. The importance
of a change of air can only be
known by those who have observed how
fast patients have recovered from operations
when removed to the country, and
clean lodgings, with well-aired beds, although
before this they were daily sinking.
Indeed no capital operation, which
is likely to induce the suppurative action,
ought to be performed, where cleanliness,
and a free circulation of air, free from
fœtor, cannot be procured.</p>

<p>It is not yet discovered that any remedy
has a specific power of removing
the hectic, or diseased formative action,
more than the local purulent <span class="nowrap">one<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span>; and,<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
therefore, we are obliged solely to trust
to these already mentioned, which have
a natural tendency to increase the healthy
action, or induce one nearly similar
to it, and especially to a proper local
treatment, by which we remove the exciting
cause.</p>

<p>When these remedies fail, and the
disease seems to continue, or increase, in
spite both of general and local remedies,
then we must, if it be practicable, remove
the diseased part by an operation;
and, in doing so, we must remember,
that delay beyond a certain period is
dangerous; because the general action
becomes so rooted, and the strength so
reduced, that recovery cannot take place.
Operating in these circumstances, therefore,
can only hasten death. The wound
will not unite nor heal, and the general
action will continue unabated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span></p>

<p>When the local action is specific, the
general one is also different from the
simple hectic; and, therefore the remedies
which are useful in simple hectic
will not be of equal advantage in these
cases, unless a specific remedy be conjoined,
as, for instance, mercury prudently
exhibited in the venereal hectic, dependent
upon a neglected local complaint.
The most frequent instance of specific
hectic is the scrophulous; for the cure of
which we possess no remedy which acts
with certainty. Whenever, therefore, the
local complaint cannot be cured, and the
hectic increases, we must, if possible, remove
the diseased <span class="nowrap">part<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span>; after which,<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
the general action, notwithstanding its
specific nature, most commonly declines;
but the constitution still remains, as formerly,
scrophulous, or even more so
than before. That this is the case,
would appear from the following fact:
If a person slightly scrophulous, although
originally sprung from a scrophulous
stock, or in whom the constitutional
disease seems to be disappearing, in
consequence of intermarriages, &amp;c. has,
by means of a local injury done to a
joint, &amp;c. the scrophulous action excited,
and consequent hectic, that person will,
after cure, have the tendency to scrophula
stronger in him than formerly;
and the disease will even frequently be
communicated to his children with its
original violence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span></p>

<h3><i>Of the Treatment of the Ulcerative Action.</i></h3>

<p>Suppuration is a natural termination
of inflammation; and the ulcerative
action is invariably induced by the suppurative,
unless this remain chronic. The
ulcerative action is to be considered as in
part a restoration of the natural one; for
we find, that it produces a restoration of
the structure, granulations being formed
by the vessels which formerly supplied
the organic particles, whilst the interstitial
vessels still yield a morbid fluid, called
pus; but this they cease to do, whenever
they again are placed in the natural
situation; that is to say, whenever they
become covered with the granulations, or
are rendered interstitial. In proportion,
then, as granulations are formed, a certain
number of vessels are rendered interstitial,<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
so that the discharge gradually
diminishes, until at last it ceases; for,
when we come to the formation of a cuticle,
we have very few interstitial vessels
left, the skin having naturally few. At
this time, the one set of vessels having
completed their action, and the part being
restored, the other also resume their
action, and a thin exhalent fluid is thrown
out by the new cuticle, which keeps it
soft and moist, and which is the natural
insensible perspiration. The action of
the two sets of vessels, then, is dependent
on each other; and, whenever one is diseased,
the other becomes also more or less
so.</p>


<p class="tac mt2em">GENUS I.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Healthy Ulcer.</i></h3>

<p>From these remarks, as well as from
those which were formerly made, it will<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
appear, that a healthy ulcer has a natural
tendency to heal, and that we ought
only to be careful not to interrupt the
natural progress, nor allow the action to
flag.</p>

<p>In this genus of ulcers, the bottom of
the sore seems to be paved with a number
of small fleshy points, with minute
interstices betwixt them, or surrounding
their bases. These are of a red colour,
with a slight shade of the purple,
and are wet with a yellowish fluid, which
is called pus; but which must of necessity
differ from the fluid yielded by suppuration.
This separates freely from the
surface, when it is wiped or touched with
a sponge, and then the granulations may
be distinctly <span class="nowrap">observed<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span>. The margins<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
are smooth, thin, and a very little rounded,
that is to say, are almost imperceptibly
raised above the granulations, a
circumstance which is essential to this
ulcer, because, were they both on the
same level, it would show, that the cicatrizing
process did not go on properly;
for, whenever the granulations rise to the
level of the surface, they ought instantly
to form skin. This cicatrix, which extends
gradually from the circumference
to the centre, is of a pale red colour;
but the integuments immediately beyond
it are white, and of the natural appearance.
Sometimes, from a slight deviation
or imperfection, one spot of the disk rises
to the level sooner than the rest; but, in
this case, it immediately skins, and the
cicatrix extends from this in the same<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
way as from the circumference, until they
both meet. The sore is free from pain,
the only sensation being a slight degree
of smarting, or itchiness.</p>

<p>The treatment of this ulcer is very
simple; for, in most cases, it is only essentially
necessary that we prevent the
operation of hurtful causes. We defend
the part, by covering it with a soft pledget
of lint, and keep it warm. When the
cicatrization has commenced, it may be
assisted by using an ointment containing
any harmless powder, in such a proportion
as to form a paste or scab upon the
<span class="nowrap">part<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span>, by which we afford an artificial<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
covering, which remains in close contact
with the granulations; and, by thus
bringing them nearly into the same circumstances
as when skin is formed, the
cicatrizing action is accelerated. The
same effect is sometimes produced, by allowing
the pus to form a scab over superficial
sores, by exposing them to the
air, without any covering.</p>

<p>Dry lint is a very useful application;
but, as it is apt to stick to the granulations,
and tear them, when tender, it
ought always to be well moistened before
removal, which should be attempted
slowly.</p>

<p>Mild ointments, such as the simple
cerate, are frequently employed; but
they must be free from all rancidity, otherwise
they fret the skin, or injure the
sore. In general, they are less useful than<span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
dry lint. When we do employ them,
they ought to be applied only to the granulations
and cicatrix, and not to the
sound skin. More frequently we use
these ointments spread on a pledget of
linen, to keep the dry lint on the sore.</p>

<p>Poultices are also recommended in
these cases; but they possess no peculiar
advantage, and are apt to make the part
feeble, and more likely to break out
again.</p>

<p>Moderate pressure, by keeping up
the action, is generally of service; but
it is still more necessary when the action
begins to flag, or becomes stationary. In
this case, a compress ought to be placed
over the sore, and the whole member
rolled firmly round with a cotton bandage
or, what will be still more useful,
the part should be encircled with strips,<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
spread with adhesive plaster, in the way
which will afterwards be mentioned.
Pressure acts by taking away the condition
of vacuity; it forms an artificial covering
and interstices for the superficial
granulations, by which the natural process
of forming granulation and skin is
greatly assisted. The parts are, in this
way, not only more quickly formed, but
also in greater perfection; and their
powers of action are greater. The cure
is therefore more permanent, and the
part is not so apt to die, or ulcerate
again, as when healed with simple dressings.</p>

<p>This practice, which is useful in ulcers
which from the first are healthy, is
still more necessary in curing those which
were formerly diseased, but have now
become healthy; because, in them, the
action is still more apt to flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span></p>

<p>The healing of large healthy ulcers
which succeed to wounds, &amp;c. will also
be much hastened, if we artificially diminish
the size of the cavity, and procure
contact. Whenever one part can be
brought in contact with another, it ought
to be done, if the figure and functions
of the part be not thereby injured, or if
pain be not produced by doing so.</p>

<p>The older authors, from a mistaken
theory, never allowed the action to proceed
uninterrupted, or never co-operated
with it in a rational manner. In every
ulcer, it was necessary, first, to digest, or
suppurate it, which was done with turpentine,
or basilicon; next it was to be
deterged with turpentine, mixed with
yolk of eggs, or by the red precipitate;
then it was to be incarned by sarcotics,
such as tincture of myrrh and aloes, balsam
of Peru, frankincense, &amp;c.; lastly,<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
the surface was to be dried into a callus,
with dragon’s blood, white-lead, chalk,
&amp;c. These plans have, however, been
long laid aside; but some practitioners
still advise the use of styptics and spirit
of wine to produce a cicatrix; they forget,
however, that skin is formed by a
different process than corrugation.</p>

<p>The diet ought to be good, in all cases
of ulcers; but spiritous liquors, and the
irregularities of life, must be avoided.</p>

<p>In ulcers of the legs, if pressure be
employed, rest is not absolutely requisite;
but, if this be not used, no cure
can be obtained, if the patient walk about.
Even if the adhesive plaster be
applied, we ought not to allow of so
much motion as to produce fatigue, or
any uneasiness in the sore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span></p>

<p>The treatment, then, of this genus of
ulcers, may be comprised in two aphorisms.</p>

<p>First, When the action is, from the
first, healthy and vigorous, and is continuing
so, all which is essentially necessary,
is to defend the part, and prevent the
operation of any cause which might injure
the action, such as cold, too much
heat, mechanical irritation, &amp;c. This
may be done, by applying a bit of dry
lint, or a rag spread with simple ointment,
and wrapping the limb round
with a flannel roller. But, if the action
begins to flag, as it often does in large
ulcers, or if the process become stationary,
we must then indispensibly have recourse
to gentle pressure.</p>

<p>Second, When the action has, at any<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
one period, been diseased, or too low, but
has been restored to a proper state, we
must of necessity continue gentle pressure,
and treat the sore as if the action
were stationary, although it may not be
so.</p>


<p class="tac mt2em">GENUS II.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Indolent Ulcer.</i></h3>

<p>In this genus, the action is diminished,
and, consequently, rendered imperfect
and diseased.</p>

<p>Indolent ulcers, like those of the
next genus, are divisible into two species:
First, that in which both parts of the ulcerative
action, namely, the granulating
and purulent, are equally diseased, and
equally imperfectly performed: Second,<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
that in which one part is more affected
than a<span class="nowrap">nother<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>.</p>

<p>The first species is distinguished by
the following symptoms, which appear
in greater or less degrees, according to
the diminution and imperfection of the
action.</p>

<p>The granulations are pale, and imperfectly
formed, partaking less of the firmness
and organisation of the healthy
fleshy granulations in proportion to the
affection of the action. They are obtuse,
and scarcely at all elevated; and,<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
therefore, the surface loses its doted, or
red pointed appearance. The discharge
is thin, and of a whitish colour, at the
same time that we frequently observe
isolated spots of lymph interwoven here
and there with the imperfect granulations.
Although these granulations are
said not to be elevated, yet the surface
often exhibits a species of fungus; but
the individual granulations are not elevated,
or pointed. This fungus never
rises higher than the twentieth part of
an inch above the level of the surrounding
<span class="nowrap">skin<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span>, and often appears only at
particular parts of the surface. It is pale,
and somewhat of a gelatinous appearance.
The pain is trifling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span></p>
<p>In more advanced cases, the whole
disk is covered with a thin layer of lymphatic
substance, which adheres firmly,
and gives the idea of a thin pellicle being
thrown over the granulations, which
are seen imperfectly and irregularly
through it. The discharge is generally
thin, like serum, and <span class="nowrap">considerable<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span>. The
edges are hard and tumefied, sometimes
of a light purple colour, at other times
<span class="nowrap">white<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span>. The surrounding integuments
are also hard and thickened, at least in
old ulcers, and the veins are generally
more or less varicose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span></p>

<p>These appearances vary in degree from
the soft pale surface, and thin whitish purulent
discharge, with slightly thickened
edges, to the state now described. The
pain, when compared to the size of the
ulcer, is not considerable.</p>

<p>This genus may occur, in a slight degree,
in recent sores, from neglect, &amp;c.;
but it is chiefly after ulcers have been of
long standing, that they assume these appearances
in the greatest degree. They
may then be said to have become chronic,
or habitual; and, in many instances,
it is absolutely impossible to restore the
action to its natural state, and produce
<span class="nowrap">recovery<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span></p>
<p>The second species is distinguished by
the paleness and imperfection of the granulations,
whilst the discharge is tolerably
good; but it never can be equal to
that of the healthy ulcer; because, when
one part of the action is affected, the other
is also more or less affected. This
species does not require any more particular
observation or remark, because it
is to be treated exactly as the first, of
which it is often just a slighter degree, or
a forerunner; for it is frequently the first
change which takes place in a healthy
ulcer. When it becomes diseased, it does
not continue long; for both parts soon
come to suffer in the same proportion;
in which case, the ulcer belongs to the
first species. For this reason, we never
find old ulcers belonging to this species.</p>

<p>Chronic ulcers sometimes induce a
disease of the bones, &amp;c. below; but, in<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
this case, they generally are converted
into a different genus. They also come
naturally, in consequence of the great
imperfection of their action, and the consequent
want of power, to act beyond
the due proportion betwixt action and
power; and, therefore, most ulcers of
this genus come at last, if neglected, to
belong to the next.</p>

<p>The most effectual remedy for these
ulcers is pressure. This has been long
employed, by means of tight rollers
wound round the limb, or by the laced
stocking. But, of late, a more effectual
method has been proposed, namely, a
bandage of adhesive plaster, which applies
itself closely to the surface, and produces
a state of artificial contact and covering.
This has been recommended by
Dr. Darwin in the form of a many-tailed
bandage, and by Mr. Baynton in the<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
form of strips, wrapped round the limb.
The following is the method of applying
them: A strip of adhesive plaster, about
an inch broad, and so long as to encircle
the limb and cross at each end, is to be
warmed, and the middle of it applied to
that part of the limb which is exactly
opposite to the sore; both ends are now
to be brought forward, and one of them
laid tightly over the under part of the
sore (if it be so large as not to be covered
with one strip), whilst the other is
brought firmly over this from the opposite
side, and doubled down upon it.
The ends of the strip thus fold over each
other at the ulcer. Another strip is then
to be applied to the part of the sore contiguous
to this which is not yet covered,
and so on in succession, until the whole
be covered. This is the best way of applying
the strips, if the integuments be
firm; but, if they be loose and yielding,<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
it will be useful to push forward the loose
skin from behind, with the strips, as we
bring them forward; and, instead of
laying down first one end, and then the
other over it, make the two ends cross
each other at the same time, and lay
them down upon the skin, and not on
each other, the under end covering the
lower part of the sore, and the upper the
part next it. The same strip, therefore,
covers two portions of the surface, whereas,
in the first way, it covered only one;
but, in this case, the strip must be longer,
as it must fairly cross the ulcer on
each side, and be retained by sticking to
the adjacent skin. When the ulcer is
deep, the strip will press only on the
margins; and, therefore, it will be useful
to fill up the surface with a fold of
soft lint. A thin cotton roller is now to
be wound firmly round the limb, beginning
at the extremity, and continuing<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
the bandage to the next joint above the
sore.</p>

<p>By this contrivance, we obtain a firm
covering to the granulations, and bring
a substance in contact with each individual.
We then restore, as it were, the
natural state of the parts, each granulation
having a substance in contact with
it; and a slight interstice is left between
each, owing to their pointed structure.
They become, therefore, similar, in this
respect, to the organic particles of internal
parts; on which account, healing
goes on more quickly, and the organic
particles, or granulations, are deposited
in greater perfection, and with greater
powers of action; for the unusual and
morbid condition of exposure and want
of contact is now removed. The same
circumstances promote cicatrization, when
the granulations have risen to a proper<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
height. This is more evidently seen in
the cure which is effected of the smaller
ulcers, by dusting them with chalk, &amp;c.
or dressing them with an ointment made
thick with some mild powder, by which
a scab, or covering, is formed, which operates
clearly independently of pressure.
Pressure, applied with this view, ought to
be moderate and permanent, and may be
used with utility in almost every case of
solution of continuity, however healthy
the action may be. But, besides being of
use in this way, pressure also produces a
second set of effects, by mechanically exciting
action in the part to which it is
applied. Applied to the skin, it increases
the cuticular action, and the skin is formed
thicker. Applied to a weakened part,
it increases the natural action of that
part, and strengthens it: This is seen in
the instance of debilitated muscles, &amp;c.
But, if the pressure be too great, then a<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
morbid increase of action takes place,
which even goes the length of inflammation,
if the pressure be considerable; and
this inflammation is either strong or
weak, according as the pressure has operated;
for, if many vessels be obstructed,
as is commonly the case, then the power
of the part is injured, and the action is
weak; or, the same happens if pressure
be applied in any manner to a weak part,
or if the constitution be weak; as, for
instance, from previous disease.</p>

<p>Pressure, applied to a part, increases
in particular the functions of absorption
and deposition. If moderate, these functions
are moderately increased, and the
structure of the part continues either the
same, or it augments in size, as we observe,
in the effects of walking, on the
skin of the feet; but, if the pressure be
greater, then these functions are morbidly<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
increased, the particles are deposited
imperfectly formed, and are as quickly
taken up. The structure is therefore
destroyed, and a vacuity formed. These
effects are produced more easily upon diseased
than healthy structures; because
their powers of acting, and sustaining
action, are less. Friction is in this respect
similar to pressure.</p>

<p>From these remarks, we may understand
the mechanical utility of pressure
in the cure of ulcers; for, when in a proper
degree, it causes the absorption and
destruction of the callous edges, or diseased
substance, and likewise makes, if
moderate, the diseased granulations be
taken up, and more healthy ones be
formed. We may likewise perceive, that,
if the degree be too great, the action will
become of an inflammatory nature, and
injury will be done. We are therefore<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
frequently under the necessity of counteracting
this hurtful effect; for, the degree
of pressure which is requisite for answering
the first intention in old sores, or
inducing action, in consequence of bringing
the granulations or particles into the
natural state of being in contact with
some body, or covered by <span class="nowrap">it<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span>, is often attended<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
with such mechanical irritation,
that the one effect would destroy the other,
unless we kept the action within
due bounds, by applying cold to the part.
In healthy ulcers, the pressure necessary to
produce its first set of effects, or to accelerate
healing, by producing contact, is so
trifling, that no counteracting effect takes
place by the production of the second
set of effects; and, therefore, no cold requires
to be applied: But, in old ulcers,
the pressure must be greater; and, therefore,
cold water must be constantly applied
to the bandage over the sore, by
means of a sponge. We thus indeed lessen
the effects of pressure on the absorbing
system, and, therefore, the callus will
be longer of being destroyed; but we,<span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
on the other hand, prevent the action of
the granulations from being rendered
morbid.</p>

<p>The good effects of pressure, applied
in a degree proportioned to the effect
which we wish to produce, and to the
state of the sore, are so universal, that it
is unnecessary to give any examples of its
success and utility. But, at the same
time, it must be observed, that in old ulcers,
and even in many of a more recent
date, which have been much neglected, no
application whatever will produce an uninterrupted
cure; for, after some time, it
ceases to produce the same effect upon
the action. The part seems, by continuance,
to be less acted on by the agent;
the action is less affected, and slowly returns
to its former state of imperfection.
It is therefore necessary, either that we
from time to time increase the power of<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>
our application, or vary our remedies,
whenever the process becomes stationary.
The latter is generally the most effectual
way; and the remedies which we alternate
with the effects of pressure, are those
of what have been called the stimulating
kind; but which of the individuals of
this division ought to be employed, cannot
always be determined, because one
succeeds better in a particular instance
than in another. It would, however, be
of much importance, to ascertain which
in general operated most effectually; because,
if we employ one which does no
positive good, we sustain positive harm;
for the action is allowed to persevere in
a retrograde process. I, therefore, paid
particular attention to the operation of
these applications, in the patients who
were under my care in the Glasgow Infirmary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span></p>

<p>Heat is found to increase almost
every action; and, therefore, in indolent
ulcers, it is sometimes of use, especially
for a few days after we begin the management
of the sore, as it paves the way
for the action of other agents, by beginning
a change of the action. Poultices
are the vehicle by which it is most frequently
applied, and answers, in general,
better than other forms. Fomentations
are much used by many practitioners,
who employ decoctions of different kinds
of vegetables; but they have no superiority
over poultices. Dry heat was used
by M. Hevin, who held ignited charcoal
near the sore; and it is sometimes of use
to repeat this practice betwixt each dressing.</p>

<p>Electricity is of little service; because
it cannot be constantly employed;<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>
and, therefore, its operation is only temporary.</p>

<p>It is worthy of observation, that although
this kind of ulcer may be sometimes
completely cured by the use of heat,
that yet the action is not so perfect, and
consequently the structure and power of
the part is weaker, than when stimulating
dressings are employed. Exercise, or any
other cause, is therefore more apt to injure
the part afterwards, and make it
again break out into an ulcer.</p>

<p>The red precipitate, mixed with resinous
ointment, in the proportion of a
drachm of the former to an ounce of the
latter, is a very useful dressing; but the
ung. hyd. nit. mixed with four times its
weight of hog’s lard, forms an ointment
which is still more generally useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span></p>

<p>Ten grains of the cuprum ammoniatum,
rubbed up with an ounce of basilicon,
or simple ointment, is sometimes
useful, but cannot be depended on. The
same may be said of an ointment composed
of an ounce of ung. simplex, and
ten drops of the oil of cloves, or of savin.</p>

<p>Cloths dipped in the aqua zinci vitriolati,
or the solution of cuprum vitriolatum,
diluted with water, so as only to
smart moderately, are likewise of service,
but not so frequently as weak solutions
of the nitrates of silver, zinc, copper, bismuth,
and many other metallic salts, such
as muriate of mercury, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Solution of common salt, or of
nitre, of such a strength as to produce a
moderate smarting, are of temporary advantage,
but will not continue their effect
long. Indeed all solutions of saline<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
substances, whether alkaline or metallic,
are most useful when applied only for
half an hour at a time, when the sore is
dressing.</p>

<p>Mixtures of Thus, elemi, turpentine,
canadine balsam, &amp;c. with wax, or oil,
have no advantage over the common
ung. <span class="nowrap">resinosum<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span>.</p>

<p>The bile, either by itself, or diluted,
or mixed with yolk of eggs, does not
seem to be of much service.</p>

<p>Lemon juice, or the mineral acids,
particularly the nitrous, diluted so as to
be of equal strength with the juice, are<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
frequently of <span class="nowrap">service<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span>. Port wine is also
an useful lotion.</p>

<p>Infusion of Cayenne pepper, in vinegar,
added to water, in such a quantity
as to smart, forms also a very useful application.</p>

<p>Of all these remedies, the ointments
composed of the nitro-metallic salts, particularly
the mercurial, are most generally
useful: And the cure seems to be
accelerated, by applying cloths dipped in
weak solution of metallic salts, or weak
acids, during the intervals of dressing.<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
Whenever these applications fail, they
must be dropped: And those which fail
first, and soonest, seem to be the watery,
or fluid applications; and, next to these,
the simple resinous ointments.</p>

<p>These remedies generally produce
their effect first at the margins. When
this takes place, we must diminish the
strength of the application at that part,
in proportion to the activity of the action,
which is marked by the redness
and pointedness of the granulation, and
the cicatrizing state. The circumference,
and the rest of the surface, must, in
this case, be dressed with different strips
of linen, spread with different ointments.
Soft linen, spread with simple cerate, or
dry lint, which is preferable, should be
applied to the cicatrix, and cicatrizing
granulations, whilst a stimulating substance<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
is applying to the rest of the surface.</p>

<p>When the surface is obstinately diseased,
or the action very torpid and imperfect,
caustic has been applied; but,
although I have often used it, and even
applied cloths dipped in solutions of metallic
salts, so strong as to form an universal
eschar, or slough, yet no benefit whatever
was derived; for we do not thus
change the nature of the action, but only
remove a layer of the surface, and leave
that below in possession of the same
mode of action with the former. Caustic
is more useful, when applied to callus
edges; but even these are more effectually
removed, by remedies which act more
permanently, and gradually, particularly
by pressure. The ancients used to extirpate
these with the knife, but few will
consent to its use. It is indeed more<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
speedy and effectual than the caustic;
but, unless the action be afterwards properly
supported, it will be of no permanent
service.</p>

<p>The hard and thickened state of the
surrounding integuments, in old ulcers,
is best moderated by pressure; but this
must be long continued.</p>

<p>Varicose veins, were, by the ancients,
considered as canals running into
the sore, and furnishing the discharge;
but, when we consider that these varices
frequently occur without any ulceration,
or discharge, the opinion must be abandoned.
In such cases as occur alongst
with ulceration, it will be more natural
to consider the affection of the vein as a
disease dependent originally on the ulcer,
and induced by it, in the same way as
the structure and functions of other<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
neighbouring parts are changed and impaired
by the continuance of a tedious
and diseased ulcerative action. This
state of the vein being once induced in
any part of it, and even in a slight degree,
two consequences follow: First,
from the power or property of the vein
being impaired, the blood is not duly
propelled, but circulates slowly, and cannot
overcome readily the weight of the
blood above, which presses more powerfully,
in consequence of the valves being
rendered imperfect by the distension of
the vessel. The disease, therefore, gradually
increases; for, every day, the
power of acting properly diminishes, at
the same time that the mechanical necessity
for acting, or the resistance of the
column of blood increases. On account
of the dilatation of the vessels, and the
morbid or abortive effect to propel what
they are unable to do, pain is produced,<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
in the course of the varix, whenever the
legs are kept in a dependent posture, or
exercise is used. This pain is confounded
with the uneasiness arising from the
ulcer; and, therefore, these ulcers are said
to be painful, and to be attended with
pain in the course of the veins.</p>

<p>The second consequence is, that, as
the veins which are more immediately
connected with the ulcerated part, are
diseased, and do not perform their part
in the circulation properly, the functions
of the part must be still more injured,
and the varix, which originally perhaps
was produced by the ulcer, comes in its
turn to act on the sore, and prevent its
healing; for the vein not acting properly,
and conveying the blood fully, the action
at the capillaries must be injured, and
the artery and vein cannot act healthily.
If this be the case, the power of forming<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
granulations must be impeded, and these
never can be deposited in the necessary
degree of perfection.</p>

<p>Two modes of cure have been proposed,
the one palliative, and the other
radical. The first is effected by means
of rollers, or bandages, which prevent the
vein from being distended, and, therefore,
enable it the better to carry on its
circulatory function. In this way, we
prevent, to a certain degree, the hurtful
operation of the vein upon the ulcer, and
are often enabled to heal it up. But, as
we do not thus restore the vein to its natural
powers, unless in young people,
who continue the support or pressure for
years, we can obtain no permanent cure
of the varix; and very frequently the
parts again ulcerate; because, whenever
the pressure or support is withdrawn, and
the patient walks about, then the function<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
of the part becomes affected, the organic
particles are not deposited in the
same state of perfection, and the action
which is induced by exercise causes the
destruction of these granulations; or
even the very circumstance of their being
formed imperfectly is sufficient to produce
their destruction, and the opening
of the part; for all parts which have
been formerly ulcerated are most ready
to assume this action again, and the organic
particles of that part are less perfect,
and less able to bear action.</p>

<p>The second is obtained, by obliterating
the diseased vein, or interrupting its
communication with the trunk above, by
which we make the blood take a different
course, and be transmitted by healthy
veins. If we now cure the sore, we find,
that the same effects are produced as if
we used permanent pressure; and, therefore,<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
the functions of the part are more
properly performed, and the organic particles
possess greater power of acting, and
sustaining action. The older surgeons
proposed to effect the radical cure, by
tying the vein at the two extremities of
the diseased part, and cutting out the intercepted
portion, or by laying it open,
and digesting it, as they said. This,
however, was, as they confess themselves,
very seldom submitted to in ulcers of
the legs; and was rather inserted to complete
their treatises, than from a belief
that the operation ought to be insisted
on. Of late, it has been proposed by
Mr. Home, to tie only the upper extremity
of the diseased <span class="nowrap">portion<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span>, by which<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
adhesion takes place at that spot, and the
circulation is there stopped. The pressure
of the blood above is thus taken
off, and the blood from below must circulate,
in a greater degree, through vessels
which are better able to perform
their functions; and, therefore, the actions
of the capillary vessels, whether nutrition,
absorption, or conversion of the
blood from arterial into veinous, must be
more naturally performed. After the
veins are tied, they gradually become
smaller; for the pressure being permanently
removed, the diseased veins can
more fully propel their blood by lateral
branches, at the same time that they receive
less blood, more going by other
vessels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span></p>
<p>It is a curious circumstance, that although
ulcers may have remained in an
indolent state for many years, and have
become almost habitual, that yet, the
cause of the indolence being removed,
they recover their powers rapidly, and
with very little assistance. Thus, when
a varix, which originally was produced
by the ulcer, reacts on the sore, and prevents
it from healing, we find, that if
this cause be removed, the ulcer frequently
heals quickly, owing to the sudden
removal of a principal cause of indolence,
although a similar ulcer, without
varices, would not be cured by the
same application in the same time; because
then all the usual causes of indolence
would still remain to be removed,
or their effects counteracted; but, in this
case, having suddenly removed one great
cause, the action rises so much, that it
can overcome the rest, although, without<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>
this alleviation, the healing process would
not be commenced, nor continued. It may
be useful to attend to this circumstance
in every case of indolent ulcers, whether
attended by varices or not; because, if
we can remove any particular cause, we
do much toward producing a cure. Thus,
callus edges, and diseased, or thickened
integuments, &amp;c. although originally dependent
on the ulcer, yet react on it, and
prevent it from healing. If, then, by
pressure, or otherwise, we remove these
causes, we accelerate the cure.</p>

<p>As an instance of the good effects of
tying varices, I shall transcribe the following
case from Mr. Home’s Observations:
“A man, sixty years of age, had,
for many years, gained his livelihood by
going on messages, having been rendered
unfit for any more laborious employment
by a large ulcer on the left leg, just above<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
the inner ankle. The complaint
was of twelve years standing: It had
been sometimes much better than at others,
but had never been well during
the whole of that period. In the year
1792, it became so bad as to confine him
entirely. It was at this time I first saw
him. Upon examining the limb, the
veins were extremely large, and varicose;
and the trunk of the vena saphena, at
the knee, appeared almost the size of the
little finger. The size of this vein led
me to the idea of taking it up at that
part, with a view of relieving the lower
branches from the pressure of the blood,
which I believed to be the cause why the
parts remained weak, and the ulcer could
not be healed. I explained my opinions
upon this subject to the patient, and told
him, that, if he thought it worth while
to try it, I was very ready to do it for
him. The man’s desire to get well was<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
such as to induce him to embrace the offer
of any mode of treatment which afforded
the smallest chance of it. The
vein was taken up in the way that I have
mentioned: He complained of very little
pain, no improper degree of inflammation
was brought on by this operation,
the ligature came away in nine days, and
in fourteen the wound was healed.</p>

<p>“The ulcer upon the leg was dressed
with dry lint; it put on a better appearance
on the second day after the operation;
on the fourteenth it had diminished
in size one half; and in twenty-eight
days was completely healed. He was
also freed from a pain in the course of
the veins of that leg, to which he had
been subject for many years, whenever
he used any exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span></p>

<p>“He returned to his business of carrying
messages, and called upon me a
year after, perfectly well; his leg having
continued sound.”</p>

<p>Issues have been proposed for the
cure of this genus of ulcers; but, upon
the principles which have been already
mentioned, it must be evident, that they
can be of little or no service; and, I am
sure, that I never saw the smallest influence
exerted by them over an ulcer.
They are useful, however, after the ulcer
is healed, by keeping up a secreting action,
diminishing the risk of apoplexy,
&amp;c.; but then they ought never to be
introduced until the sore be nearly healed,
or until we have reason to suppose
that the sore will heal, and that they will
be required.</p>

<p>The treatment of this genus of ulcers<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
may be comprised in the following aphorisms:</p>

<p>First, When the action of an ulcer
becomes too low and imperfect, pressure
is the best remedy for restoring it to its
proper state, and for accelerating the
cure.</p>

<p>Second, Whenever this ceases to produce
any farther effect, or the action relapses,
and begins to go backward, we
must lay aside the pressure for a time,
and dress the sore with some of the stimulating
applications above mentioned,
particularly the nitro-mercurial salts;
and these, in their turn, must be laid
aside, when they cease to produce a good
effect, and the pressure be again had
recourse to.</p>

<p>Third, When we use stimulating dressings,<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
we must attend to the effects which
they produce on different parts of the
sore, and dress these differently, according
to their condition. We must likewise
proportion the strength of application
to the state of the general action.
Our remedies ought to smart most when
the action is most torpid, and the smarting
ought to continue longest; but, when
the action has begun to be more perfect
and vigorous, the same application will
often be too strong.</p>

<p>Fourth, We must, in conjunction
with this general plan, attend to particular
morbid structures, which may be
produced by the particular state of the
ulcer, and which may react on it. The
chronic thickness and hardness of the integuments,
are best removed by pressure,
and gentle frictions; but the restoration
of the natural structure is very tedious.<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
Callous edges are likewise best removed
by pressure. When this fails, caustic
must be repeatedly applied. Varicose
veins may be palliated by firm bandages,
but are, in general, after they have continued
long, only to be cured by an operation.</p>

<p>Fifth, When chronic ulcers can be
healed, it is useful to form an issue, in
order to keep up the accustomed secretory
action; but these issues have little
effect in advancing the cure.</p>


<p class="tac mt2em">GENUS III.</p>

<h3><i>Of the overacting Ulcer.</i></h3>

<p>This genus comprehends two species:
First, that in which the granulating, or
purulent process is morbidly increased,<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
or the two parts of the ulcerative action,
the granulating and the purulent, do
not correspond, or bear the same proportion
to each other that they do in a
healthy ulcer: Second, that in which a
state of general acute overaction takes
place, both parts of the ulcerative action
being equally affected, and rendered diseased.</p>

<p>For the illustration of the first species,
I may remark, that there are some actions
performed by particular parts of
the body which are apparently simple;
but there are others which are complicated,
and consist evidently of different
parts, which, in the aggregate, form a
peculiar action, but which action may be
modified according to the degree in
which these different parts exist. Thus,
there are various parts which, when
taken together, form the inflammatory<span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>
action, heat, redness, swelling, &amp;c.; but
these may, in certain cases, exist in different
proportions. The ulcerative action
is a complicated one, and consists of
the secretory and organising action, or
the purulent and granulating. These,
in a healthy ulcer, bear a certain relation
to each other, and are at all times so
connected, that, when one part is injured,
the other is also affected; but the
one part may be affected more than the
other. In the indolent ulcer, or that in
which the action is too low, both parts
are most commonly (at least after some
time) equally affected, and a state of universal
diminution, and consequent imperfection,
takes place; but, in the beginning
of this state, that is to say, when
the healthy ulcer is first becoming diseased,
and when the unhealthy condition
has made little progress, it is not
uncommon to observe an inequality in<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
the action, or the granulations more affected
than the discharge. In this genus
of ulcers, however, the inequality is more
striking, and frequently more permanent.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that though
the granulating action may be increased
beyond the purulent one, that yet the
purulent one never exists in a state of
overaction without a correspondent affection
of the granulating action; in which
case, very different effects and symptoms
are occasioned, and the second species of
overacting ulcers is produced.</p>

<p>The first species has generally been
described under the name of the fungous
ulcer, or ulcer with hypersarcosis. The
granulations are soft and indistinct. They
are imperfectly formed, and, therefore,
do not possess the pointed appearance
which they exhibit in health; nor have<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
they equal powers of action, nor longevity.
They are formed quickly, and rise
to a greater or less height above the level
of the surrounding skin. The margins
are generally soft, tumid, and of a dull
red colour. The discharge, if there be
no carious bone, is tolerably thick, and
of a white colour, and not in greater
quantity than would be yielded by a
healthy ulcer of the same size: The
quantity is even sometimes less. The
pain, unless when a bone is diseased, is
seldom considerable. This species admits
of two varieties. In the first, the
granulating process is increased, in consequence
of some affection of the action,
which is independent of any mechanical
cause. In this case, the fungus is generally
pretty firm, but commonly pale,
and the discharge tolerably good. In
the second variety, the granulating process
is increased, in consequence of some<span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
mechanical irritation underneath, such as
a piece of carious bone; and, in this
case, the fungus is softer, and less firm;
it is of a redder and more lively or fiery
colour, and is sometimes covered, in particular
parts, with spots of lymph; it bleeds
upon the slightest touch. The sore is generally
painful, and the discharge thin, serous,
and of a fœtid smell, whilst we can
frequently perceive at least one small foramen
on the surface which leads down to
the bone, and through which it may be
felt to be rough. Out of this is discharged
a thin matter from the bone, of a brownish
colour, somewhat like soup, and more
or less different from the discharge from
the rest of the surface. These luxuriant
granulations, however, must not be confounded
with those which, at a later period,
come from the bone itself, after it
has begun to ulcerate. These are generally
of a more florid red colour, though<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
sometimes pale, and rise up either through
chinks of the bare caries, or from such
portions as are denuded by a previous
exfoliation. They have, in general, a
more pointed appearance than those which
arise from the soft parts, so that, in many
cases, the fungus resembles the surface of
a strawberry, being rough. This variety
may be induced quickly, the bone being
injured, at the same time that the soft
parts are affected; but, at other times,
and perhaps more frequently, the bone
becomes diseased, in consequence of the
continuance of a simple ulcer immediately
over it; as, for instance, on the tibia.
In this case, the ulcer, which perhaps
was formerly indolent, now changes its
nature.</p>

<p>The second species exists in various
degrees, and its symptoms admit of modification
from the previous state of the<span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
ulcer. Sometimes an ulcer, although
previously healthy, has its surface excited
into a state of overaction, by exercise,
or other causes. In this case, the
sore becomes painful, and the granulations
assume first a kind of light crimson
colour, and then a brownish hue, from a
species of mortification. They do not
indeed become gangrenous, and slough,
but they approach to a state nearly resembling
death, and are absorbed. The
edges are slightly erysipelatous, and the
discharge watery. This may be called
the first degree or stage of the disease;
and the ulcer frequently recovers soon
from this, and reassumes its healthy condition.
But if it be neglected, or the
injuring causes still continue, the state of
overaction is increased, and becomes
more <span class="nowrap">perfect<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span>; that is to say, the action<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
which was injured in its different parts,
and rendered unconnected by the incipient
or new condition, becomes more
completely and connectedly performed
in its different parts, in an increased degree.
The overacting state, which, in
the first stage, took place, perhaps only
for a few hours, or at least if it continued,
did not rise to any great degree,
or receive an augmentation in this stage,
continues with violence, and generally
with exacerbation. The granulations are
absorbed almost as soon as they are deposited;
because, owing to the overaction
of the part, they are very imperfectly
organised, and possess very little life
and power of supporting <span class="nowrap">action<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span>. They
evidently appear to be in a state of overaction;<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
for they are fiery, and their colour,
whether it be red or brownish, is
bright or clear, and quite opposite to the
dull hue which even the same colour
may have in a different kind of sore.
These bleed upon the slightest touch; on
which account, the discharge is generally
bloody. The margins are red and ragged,
as if they were bitten by a mouse;
and they are evidently in an ulcerating
state. The surrounding skin is hot and
erysipelatous, the discharge is thin and
serous, and the pain great, generally somewhat
of the burning kind. This sore,
from the destruction of the granulations,
and the propagation of a morbid degree
of action, spreads as long as this condition
continues; but the progress, as long
as the ulcer belongs to this genus, or as
granulations are formed, is not very rapid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="181"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span></p>

<p>It not unfrequently happens, that,
after a sore which has been indolent has
begun to heal, it, from fatigue, or some
less evident cause, has a state of overaction
induced, in which case, different appearances
are exhibited, according to the
previous state of the sore. If it has begun
to form a natural cicatrix, this gives
way, the surface becomes livid, the discharge
thin, and the pain considerable.
A thin slough of the granulations is then
generally formed, and comes off in portions
mixed with the discharge. If this
state be not checked, it frequently comes
to exhibit the acute symptoms of the
overacting ulcer which was last described.
More frequently, however, it occurs
when the sore is still indolent, and
not in the healing state, and when the
edges still remain callous, and the granulations
foul and unhealthy. If, at this
time, a disproportionate, or overaction be<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
induced, by exercise or otherwise, we
find, that the surface becomes dark and
sloughy, the granulations flat and indistinct,
the discharge is increased, and the
margins become tumid, and of a modena
colour, whilst the surrounding integuments
are of a dull red mottled colour,
or erythematous; and the foot, if it take
place in the leg, is frequently cold, and
the pain darts down to the toe.</p>

<p>This state is not unfrequently produced
in old ulcers, by a disease of the
parts <span class="nowrap">below<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span>, which has been induced<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
by the long continuance of the ulcer,
which renders the bone carious, if it lie
immediately under it (in which case, the
first species of overacting ulcers is produced);
but, at other times, by the sympathy
of association, a diseased formative
action (owing to the diseased formative
action in the ulcer, or the imperfect granulations
which are formed) is induced
in the neighbouring parts, the muscles
become pale, and have less of their fibrous
texture, or the bone becomes rough, or
pointed, like shagreen, and also becomes
thickened, but without any appearance<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
of caries. This diseased condition of the
parts reacts on the ulcer, and induces
overaction.</p>

<p>This state of overacting may also be
induced in old ulcers, without any malformation
of the parts below, but merely
in consequence of continuance; for, after
an ulcer has remained long indolent, it
comes to act so imperfectly, that it naturally
goes beyond its power. This may
be said to be a spontaneous change, or
conversion of one genus into another.</p>

<p>We have then two varieties of this species:
First, the state of overaction induced
in an ulcer which was previously healthy;
and this admits of two stages, the incipient
and confirmed: The first sometimes
consists only of one short paroxysm:
The second continues for a longer
time, and generally depends upon the<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
neglect of the first attack. Second, the
state of overaction induced in an ulcer
which has previously been indolent; and
this admits of two subdivisions, which
arise from the condition of the ulcer at
the time of its overacting, namely, whether
it have been healing and cicatrizing,
or the edges have been callus, and the
action imperfect and morbid.</p>

<p>The observations on the cure of this
genus of ulcers must naturally be arranged
under the different species and varieties
of these ulcers.</p>

<p>In the first variety of the first species,
our object is to remove the supernumerary,
or fungous granulations, and to replace
them with others, which are formed
more slowly, and in greater perfection.</p>

<p>Pressure, applied in the manner already<span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>
explained, is one of the most useful
remedies in this variety, and ought
always to be tried first. The luxuriant
granulations are quickly absorbed, and
the succeeding ones are rendered more
compact and healthy, and the cicatrix
begins to be formed. If, however, we
apply pressure in this, or indeed in any
sore, to such a degree as to produce its
specific effect, we must counteract its irritation
by cold. If we do not, this sore
is frequently converted into the second
variety of the second species of this genus.</p>

<p>Caustic, and escharotics, have been
sometimes applied to these sores; but
they only remove a layer of granulations,
without affecting the formation of the
succeeding ones so much as some other
remedies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span></p>

<p>Stimulating applications are more
useful; for, as they act more slowly,
they produce a greater influence on the
action.</p>

<p>The cuprum vitriolatum, mixed with
simple ointment, in the proportion of a
drachm to the ounce, is frequently serviceable;
but the ung. hyd. nit. is still
more useful. One drachm of this may
be mixed with an ounce of hog’s lard
and a scruple of camphor. Red precipitate,
mixed with resinous ointment, is
also often of service.</p>

<p>The application of powdered rheubarb
is recommended by Mr. Home, and is
frequently of service.</p>

<p>Lotions of port wine, solutions of
white vitriol, or rose water, containing as<span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
many drops of l’eau <span class="nowrap">mercurielle<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> as will
make it moderately pungent, may be usefully
applied before the dressing.</p>

<p>Poultices seem to increase the diseased
state; and mild dressings do not
counteract it, but allow it to go on.</p>

<p>The second variety is only to be
cured by removing the caries bone; but
the same remedies which are used in the
first variety may be employed here, as
palliatives, or the means of preventing
the ulcer from becoming worse. By a
continuance of these applications, in cases
of slight caries, a cure may, after some
time, be obtained; for the thin layer of
diseased bone, either comes away in fragments
through an opening in the <span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span><span class="nowrap">ulcer<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span>,
or it is sometimes absorbed. This
last event, the absorption of the bone, is
particularly induced by pressure, applied
by means of the adhesive plaster; and,
therefore, where the disease is not extensive,
it is always proper to have recourse to
this; but if, upon trial, we find it to fail,
or to convert the sore into the second
species of this genus, which it sometimes
does, we must omit it.</p>

<p>As it is only in slight cases of caries
that absorption of the bone is to be expected,
we may consider it as necessary,<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
in general, as a preparatory step toward
healing, that the diseased portion of the
bone be separated, and come away externally.
It is therefore of advantage to
endeavour to accelerate this; because,
whatever does so, hastens the cure. Our
attempts, with this view, are made at
two different stages, and with different
intentions. First, when the bone has
separated, or exfoliated from the part below,
by making an incision through the
ulcerated surface, we remove the dead
part, and allow the sore to heal. This
stage may be discovered, by pushing a
probe through the opening, if there be
one, or through the granulations, down
to the layer of bone, which we find to
be elastic when we press on it. But,
even although the incision be made before
this stage has taken place, no harm
is done, because it is of use in the first
stage. Second, when the carious bone has<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
not yet exfoliated, but remains in contact
with the rest of the bone, ulceration of
the sound part not having yet taken
place, it will be useful to make an incision
down to the bone, and, as soon as
the bleeding stops, or lessens, to apply
caustic freely, in the whole course of the
incision, so as to act upon the caries, or
rough portion; or we may use the trephine,
or other remedies, which have
been formerly mentioned. It sometimes
happens, that the soft parts are, at particular
portions, and often to a considerable
extent, removed by absorption, and the
bone, at these parts, is left bare. In this
case, no incision is necessary, except occasionally
through some bands of granulations
which extend across the bare bone;
and, therefore, we can at once apply our
remedies to the bone, or make perforation
with the trephine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span></p>

<p>The second species requires to be
treated differently, according to its varieties.</p>

<p>As the incipient stage of the first variety
frequently consists of only one short
paroxysm, it would often be unnecessary
to have recourse to any peculiar treatment;
but, as it is impossible, a priori,
to say whether the state of evacuation is
to continue, it is requisite, in every instance,
to vary our treatment, and apply
the proper remedies for the disease.</p>

<p>Poultices are frequently useful in
this kind of ulcer, when the surface is
dark coloured, and the integuments are
not yet affected. They have sometimes
an effect of checking the morbid state, if
this be not already done; but they more
generally promote the absorption of the
morbid granulations, after which the surface<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
becomes healthy. If, however, the
action be still greater, and more permanent,
then the ulcer is tending toward
the confirmed, or perfect state of overaction,
and poultices are not of equal service;
they are even sometimes hurtful.</p>

<p>Gentle pressure, accompanied with
the use of cold water, is of service in the
same cases in which poultices are employed;
that is to say, when the action
has not become perfect, but has rather
begun to subside, and the granulations
remain dark coloured, and in a dying
state. They are absorbed, and replaced
with more perfect and healthy granulations.</p>

<p>When, however, the action still continues
in the same state of overacting, or
seems to be increasing, these remedies
are rather hurtful; and we will derive<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
more benefit from using applications of a
gentle stimulating nature, which restore
the action to a more perfect and natural
state, in the same way as they cure the
inflammatio debilis. For this purpose,
one of the best applications is the following:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
R.&ensp;Opii drachmas duas.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Camphoræ scrupulum.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Vini Albi uncias quatuor. Macera per triduum, dein cola.
</p>

<p>This may be applied by means or
a bit of lint to the sore. It generally
produces considerable smarting for a few
minute, after which the pain abates.
The application is to be repeated every
hour, or every two hours, until the sore begins
to look healthy, and the pain abates.
The adhesive plaster ought then to be
substituted in its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span></p>

<p>Laudanum may also be employed
with the same intention, but it is inferior
to the other.</p>

<p>Lemon juice is also sometimes useful,
and may be employed where the opiated
wine fails, or is not at hand.</p>

<p>When the state of overaction becomes
confirmed, and progressive, the
sore spreads, becomes very painful, and
assumes the appearances which have been
already described. In this case, the application
of carrot, or turnip poultices,
is frequently useful. These vegetables
are sometimes made into a poultice by
boiling them, and, at other times, by
rasping them down raw.</p>

<p>Camomile flowers, boiled in milk,
and then expressed, yield a decoction,
which, when made into a poultice with<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
crumb of bread, frequently abates the
pain. Sometimes the application of
cloths, dipped in fine oil, give relief.</p>

<p>These sores are also frequently reduced
to a more healthy state, by applying
cloths dipped in the following mixture:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
R.&ensp;Ammon. <span class="nowrap">Hepatizatæ<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> guttas decem.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Aq. Font. uncias octo.
</p>

<p>This produces a moderate degree of smarting
for a little time, during which the
former painful sensation arising from the
sore lessens, and does not return for some
time. When the peculiar pain of the ulcer
again manifests itself, the solution is
again to be applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span></p>

<p>An ointment, consisting of two
drachms of powdered opium, and one
ounce of simple cerate, is also a very useful
application.</p>

<p>Sprinkling the sore with red precipitate,
or touching the surface with
caustic, frequently stops the disease.</p>

<p>The kind of erythematous affection,
which frequently affects the surrounding
skin, is best removed by stimulating applications,
which abate the pain or hot
sensation, and make it less apt to ulcerate.
The following is a very useful application
for this purpose. The affected
part is to be lightly dusted with it occasionally:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
R.&ensp;Hyd. Precip. Rub. unc. i.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Pulv. Opii semiunc.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Cretæ Ppt. unc. ii. Tere simul ut fiat pulvis subtiliss.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span></p>

<p>When, by any of these applications,
the state of overaction is overcome, pressure
is the best remedy for preserving
our ground, and producing a cure; for,
remedies which may be useful in the
diseased state, will be hurtful when this
state is removed.</p>

<p>In this sore, anodynes are to be freely
employed internally; for, given sparingly,
they do no <span class="nowrap">good<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span>.</p>

<p>All the applications ought to be made
gently, and lightly; because any mechanical
irritation increases the disease.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span></p>
<p>The second variety of this species is
a very troublesome ulcer, and admits, as
has been already observed, of two divisions:
First, it not unfrequently happens,
that, after an indolent ulcer has been in
a healing state for some time, a state of
overaction is induced, by fatigue, or other
causes, particularly by the natural
inability of the newly formed, and not
completely perfect granulations, to sustain
the action which is necessarily induced
in them by their connection with
other parts (upon the principle of the
communication of action). In this case,
the sore becomes foul, dark coloured, and
painful, whilst the cicatrix ulcerates, and
the new granulations die, so that, in a
short time, the ulcer regains its original
size, and even spreads slowly to a
greater extent. Second, an old ulcer may,
without having been previously in a
healing state, become converted into the<span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>
overacting ulcer; because the surface has
its power so weakened, that common agents,
which naturally excite action in
the part, excite a disproportioned and
morbid action in the ulcer; but this action
is of the low kind, and bears somewhat
the same relation to the first species,
(or overacting ulcerative action, in
ulcers previously healthy,) that the inflammatio
debilis does to the inflammatio
valida. In this case, the surface is
bloody, and the half-formed granulations
are of a livid colour; the callus
edges are of a dusky red, or modena colour;
the integuments are generally mottled;
the inferior part of the limb is cold
and painful.</p>

<p>In the cure of the first division, we
must enjoin rest, as in the second variety
of the first species, and apply cloths,
dipped in a mixture of two parts of laudanum<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
and one of camphorated spirit of
wine, which produces at first considerable
smarting; but the sensation is different
from the former pain; and, although
uneasy, is yet more tolerable than the
peculiar pain of the ulcer. This application
ought to be renewed two or three
times in the course of the day, until the
surface becomes of a better appearance,
and the pain abates.</p>

<p>The application of the powder of bark
to these sores is sometimes, but very seldom,
of <span class="nowrap">service<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span>.</p>

<p>A poultice, formed of decoction of
camomile flowers, opium, and <span class="nowrap">charcoal<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span>,<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
is frequently of use, and should be employed
when the laudanum and camphorated
spirit fail. This should be applied
cold.</p>

<p>In the second division, the fermenting
<span class="nowrap">poultice<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> is often of service; but it must,
like all other applications, be continued
no longer than the state which it was intended
to remove remains. If we continue
it too long, we do hurt; for, if it be
kept on when it produces continued pain,
it induces a state of overaction, similar to<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
that which it was intended to destroy.
Whenever the surface becomes redder, and
the pain less, it may be useful to employ
some other application, such as laudanum,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The same observations apply to the
use of the gastric juice. Cloths dipped
in this sometimes make the overacting
surface slough off, and leave the parts
below more healthy. The same may be
said of the expressed juice of sorrel.</p>

<p>Lime water sometimes operates in the
same way.</p>

<p>Red precipitate, mixed with its weight
of powdered opium, and half its weight
of camphor, may be usefully sprinkled
over the surface.</p>

<p>A pound of the recent leaves of hem<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>lock,
boiled for half an hour in two
pounds of milk, and then expressed, forms
an application which sometimes abates
the pain, and renders the action more
healthy. The juice is to be made into
a poultice with crumb of bread.</p>

<p>Decoction of the walnut tree leaves,
applied by means of pledgets of linen, or
made into a poultice with bran, is occasionally
of service.</p>

<p>When, by any of these applications,
the morbid state of the ulcer is removed,
it is to be dressed according to the genus
into which it is then converted.</p>

<p>After these remarks, the treatment
of this genus of ulcers may be comprised
in the following observations:</p>

<p>First, In the first variety of the first<span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
species, or the simple fungous ulcer, the
cure is to be attempted by pressure, and
gentle stimulants, which render the action
more natural, and the granulations,
in consequence, more perfect and compact.</p>

<p>Second, In the second variety of this
species, we are to employ the same remedies,
as palliatives, or as means which
may promote the exfoliation of the bone.
But, if the disease in the bone be more
extensive and tedious, we must cut down
through the ulcer, and apply caustic, or
mechanical cures, such as perforation, to
the caries.</p>

<p>Third, In the incipient stage of the
first variety of the second species, we
must avoid motion, and all other such
causes as tend simply to increase action.
When the disease has consisted of one<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
short paroxysm, which has terminated,
we must promote the absorption of the
diseased granulations, and the process of
replacing them with others which are
more perfect, which is effected by such
remedies as render the action which
forms them more natural. This is best
done by gentle pressure, and sometimes
by poultices. If, however, the paroxysm
continue longer, but in a moderate degree,
we must use such applications as
tend more directly to change the action,
and diminish the morbid condition; such
as camphorated and opiated preparations,
and sometimes the vegetable acids.</p>

<p>Fourth, When this state becomes
confirmed and progressive, the action being
violent, we must use remedies nearly
similar to those which are employed in
the last case, and which are useful in the
cure of the inflammatio debilis, at the<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
same time that we enjoin rest, and keep the
part as easy as possible. In some instances,
the action cannot be overcome directly by
any application, but is rather increased by
them. In this case, we must lay these
aside, and use mild and light applications;
such as fine oil, fresh cream, &amp;c.;
at the same time that we avoid the general
causes tending to increase action;
such as motion, heat, spirits, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Fifth, When this state occurs in chronic
ulcers, we must use such remedies as
tend to remove the dead or dying granulations
which frequently cover the surface,
and such as at the same time produce
a more natural action, and restore
to the succeeding granulations greater
powers and perfection, and a more healthy
mode of acting. Stimulating applications
frequently have this effect; such
as the fermenting poultice, precipitate<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
ointment, &amp;c.; at other times, narcotic
applications; such as cicuta, &amp;c. are
useful.</p>

<p>Sixth, In these ulcers, the redness
and pain of the skin which surrounds
the ulcer, is to be treated as the inflammatio
assuefacta, by being dusted with
the powder which has been already mentioned,
or by similar remedies.</p>

<p>Seventh, In all of these ulcers, where
the action is violent, much benefit will
be derived from inducing the general
narcotic action to a considerable extent.
Anodynes are therefore to be freely administered,
at the same time that we employ
the proper local remedies.</p>

<p>Eighth, Whenever the ulcer becomes
more healthy, and the action less morbid,
the strength of the application is to be<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
diminished; and, when the state of overaction
is destroyed, it must be treated as
the indolent ulcer, because the granulations
are still feeble. Pressure is most
useful in this case.</p>


<p class="tac mt2em">GENUS IV.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Inflammatory Ulcer.</i></h3>

<p>It sometimes happens, that the ulcerative
action becomes converted into
the inflammatory; the discharge diminishes,
and sometimes ceases; the surface
is red; and the edges and surrounding
skin are elevated and inflamed.
This, which has been called the phlogosis
<span class="nowrap">ulceris<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span>, strictly speaking, does not belong<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
to the division of ulcers, because
the ulcerative action is destroyed; but,
as it is preceded, and very quickly followed
by this action, and as the solution
of continuity, and other external appearances
continue, this affection may be allowed
to rank as a genus amongst ulcers,
in conformity to common language.</p>

<p>When the pain and inflammation are
considerable, leeches are frequently applied
with utility in the vicinity of the
sore; but it is more generally useful to
apply warm poultices, which restore the
secretory state, and the ulcerative action.</p>


<p class="tac mt2em">GENUS V.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Suppurating Ulcer.</i></h3>

<p>This genus, like the last, accurately
speaking, does not belong to the class of<span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
ulcers; but, as it is so intimately connected
with it, both in its causes, and treatment,
and appearances, it is of some practical
utility to admit the arrangement.</p>

<p>When an abscess is opened before the
ulcerative action is induced, we have an
open suppurating sore; but this is not
the sore which is meant to be described
here.</p>

<p>The suppurating ulcer is, when simple,
and independent of any specific action,
most frequently only a high degree of the
overacting ulcer; but, as its symptoms
are somewhat different, and as it nearly
resembles some specific sores, differing
from these only in the absence of the peculiar
action, resulting from the application
of a poison, it may be proper to consider
this as a separate genus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span></p>

<p>When the ulcerative action is very
imperfectly carried on, which often arises
from overaction, we find, that the organic
particles are thrown out, not in the
form of granulations, but in a more inorganic
state, and lie upon the surface,
mixed with the discharge from the other
set of vessels. This has the appearance
of very thick tough pus, and the sore
which yields it may properly be considered
to be in a suppurating state. This
ulcer is distinguished by the pain which
attends it, by a redness which surrounds
the margin, and a hardened base, whilst
the cavity of the ulcer is filled up with a
thick straw-coloured substance, somewhat
like lymph, which adheres firmly to the
surface. This is improperly called a
slough.</p>

<p>This appearance and condition may
be excited in a simple ulcer, without any<span class="pagenum" title="213"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span>
apparent application of contagion; but
it is still more frequently the consequence
of some morbid matter acting on the
part, and producing specific ulceration,
which will be afterwards considered. I
may only here observe, that it has, in
some of these cases, been considered as a
species of gangrene, as, for instance, in
the cynanche maligna; but, whatever
may take place in the advanced stages of
this disease, there is at first no gangrene,
but a suppurating ulcer, which throws
out imperfect granulations, or rather a
morbid purulent discharge (for the one
runs naturally into the other), which
forms what is called a slough.</p>

<p>The treatment of this ulcer consists
first in procuring a separation of the tenacious
covering, by such remedies as
shall, at the same time that they do this,
make the action more healthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span></p>

<p>A pretty strong solution of the argentum
nitratum, or l’eau mercurielle,
diluted with equal parts of distilled water,
applied by means of a brush, frequently
produce the desired effect.</p>

<p>The acetous infusion of Cayenne pepper,
applied in the same way, is likewise
useful.</p>

<p>Poultices made of decoction of camomile
flowers, and equal parts of charcoal
and barley meal, are sometimes of
service in removing the matter, and rendering
the action more truly ulcerative.</p>

<p>Opiates ought to be freely administered.</p>

<p>When this state of the sore is removed,
the ulcer must be treated according
to the condition of the ulcerative action.<span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
Most frequently it belongs first to the
overacting genus, and must be treated
accordingly, and then to the genus of
indolent ulcers, in which case, pressure is
to be employed as a termination to the
cure.</p>

<p>When an overacting ulcer has, without
the assistance of local applications,
ceased to overact, it not unfrequently
suppurates; that is to say, no granulations
are formed, but the two sets of vessels
throw out an inorganic matter, and
the surface of the sore has a lymphatic
appearance.</p>

<p>The best dressing for this state is dry
lint, with a pledget spread with cerate
laid over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="216"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span></p>


<h3><i>Of the Effects of the Ulcerative Action on the
Constitution.</i></h3>

<p>The condition and qualities of an ulcer,
do not, in every instance, depend
upon causes which are entirely local, but
frequently are connected with some general
state, or mode of action, of the
system. General weakness must, for example,
influence the performance of any
action in a particular part; and, therefore,
an ulcer in those who are infirm,
and exhausted, cannot readily perform
the necessary healthy action, or proceed
quickly toward a cure; nor is it easy, in
these circumstances, by any local applications,
to communicate the necessary action,
and the correspondent power, which
shall enable the part to heal. In the
same way, there are some people so irritable,
that an ulcer shall very readily assume<span class="pagenum" title="217"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>
the overacting state, which can
only be removed by such remedies as act
on the general system. Besides those
which may be considered as simple conditions,
there are many other actions,
which are peculiar and unnatural, which
influence the ulcer, or in which ulcers often
appear as symptoms. These ulcers
are specific, and must be afterwards considered.</p>

<p>As the state of the system has a considerable
influence on the condition of an
ulcer, so also has the state of the ulcerative
action an effect on the constitution.
A healthy ulcer, unless very extensive,
has little effect on the system; but, unhealthy
ulcers, or those which are very
large, although the action may be sufficiently
perfect, produce a greater or less
degree of the general diseased formative
action, or what is called hectic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span></p>

<p>From the principles which have already
been laid down, it may easily be
understood how an unhealthy ulcer should
induce hectic. When considering the
doctrine of suppuration, the effects of
this on the constitution, or the production
of a general diseased formative action
were attended to. It was also mentioned,
when considering ulceration, that
the ulcerative action had a tendency to
produce similar effects; and this it does,
with a certainty proportioned, cæteris paribus,
to the unhealthy condition of the
action, or its approximation to the suppurative
action; for the less perfect that
the ulcerative action is, the more nearly
does it resemble the suppurative one.</p>

<p>Healthy ulcers, if very extensive,
produce likewise considerable effects on
the constitution. This is chiefly perhaps
owing to the purulent action, which<span class="pagenum" title="219"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
makes a part of the ulcerative one; for
this morbid local secretory action induces
a general change, in the same way as other
acute changes, of either the formative
action itself, or any other intimately
connected with it, such as the interstitial.
But, besides this cause, the granulating
action, although healthy, co-operates
with the diseased interstitial action,
or the purulent part of the ulcerative action;
because, although the granulations,
or organic particles, be healthy, yet they
are formed in an unnatural situation, and
with greater rapidity, and in greater
numbers, in a given time, than naturally
they ought to be; and, therefore, the action
of the part requires greater power
for its continuance than is possessed.
There is consequently, then, weakness
produced, which, by association, affects
the system, and co-operates with the diseased
formative action, increasing the general<span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
disease. The consequence of this
state, likewise, is, that the ulcer comes,
after some time, to be rendered unhealthy,
owing to the deficiency of power to
support the necessary action; in which
case, the granulating action comes to be
also diseased, and co-operates still more
with the former morbid condition of the
interstitial vessels, or the purulent action,
which, although a part of a healthy ulcerative
action, is yet itself a morbid secretion,
and an unnatural action.</p>

<p>The effects of the ulcerative action on
the constitution, are to be alleviated by
good diet, free air, and the other remedies
which have been pointed out when
formerly considering hectic, to which I
now refer. I shall only observe, that
some of these remedies are employed occasionally
with little judgment, and when
they are not indicated. It is, for in<span class="pagenum" title="221"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>stance,
a common practice with some, to
prescribe the bark for the cure of every
ulcer, whether the constitution be affected
or not. But, from many trials, I am
confident that it is of very little service,
unless when a general disease, whether it
be called weakness or hectic, exists.</p>

<p>When the proper remedies for the
cure of hectic, conjoined with necessary
local applications, fail, the diseased part
must be removed; but, before doing so,
it is, in every instance, proper to form a
pea issue, in order still to keep up a secretory
action, the good effects of which
have been already noticed.</p>

<p>The restlessness, and febrile symptoms,
which are sometimes produced by painful
sores, are best relieved by anodynes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="222"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span></p>


<h3><i>Of the Cure of the Inflammatio Debilis, and
the Treatment of Mortification.</i></h3>

<p>The causes and nature of mortification
having been already explained, I
shall now consider the means of prevention,
and the method of cure. The remedies
necessary for procuring the resolution,
or suppuration of the inflammatio
valida, having been formerly enumerated,
it will be unnecessary here to
make any repetition, or to say more than
that we are to prevent mortification by
endeavouring to induce one or other of
the other terminations, and that the remedies
which do so are to be employed
with a promptitude and assiduity proportioned
to the greatness of the action
compared to the powers of the part; and,
therefore, that in the intestines, &amp;c. we<span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
must pursue our course speedily, if we
expect to prevent gangrene.</p>

<p>Mortification, however, is still
more apt to succeed the inflammatio debilis,
or inflammation of weakened parts;
and, therefore, the treatment of this will
now more naturally come to be considered,
as forming a part of the prophylaxis
of mortification, than in any other
place.</p>

<p>The most frequent instance which we
have of the inflammatio debilis, is the
inflammation of parts which have been
previously benumbed with cold; but it
may also be produced by the action of
any of the common exciting causes of inflammation,
in weak and reduced habits,
or by bruises in sound parts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When a part has been exposed to<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
much cold, it may inflame, from two
causes: First, the communication of action;
secondly, the application of subsequent
stimulants, more especially heat.
Both of these tend to excite an action in
the part, which is greater than its power
would naturally perform, and, therefore,
it becomes diseased, or inflammation is
produced, and the little energy which did
remain is soon destroyed. The operation
of the first cause is prevented by lessening
the action of the surrounding parts,
by the application of moderate cold,
whilst we avoid motion, and whatever
may tend to act directly on the part, and
co-operate with this cause. The operation
of the second cause is prevented by
keeping away every agent which will
tend to excite action, or at least those
which tend to do so suddenly. In the
generality of cases, it is perhaps most proper
at first to do nothing; because, whatever<span class="pagenum" title="225"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
we apply, tends to excite a greater
action than can be sustained; we ought,
therefore, to delay any remedy until the
part has begun to recover itself, and the
action and corresponding power has begun
naturally to increase; we may then
interfere, by applying such remedies as
increase the action, which are perhaps
now more useful, by preserving the
ground which is gained, than by increasing
still farther the action. Of this
kind is heat, which must, upon this principle,
be applied with great caution, and
must, in its degree, be nicely adjusted to
the existing state of action. When a
part, then, is benumbed with cold, we
ought at first to apply a degree of heat,
very little above that which the parts
were formerly exposed to, which, in one
sense, may be said to be doing nothing;
for this step is intended merely to prevent<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
farther injury. When this is continued
for a short time, we may suppose
that the part has begun to act a little
more in a natural way, which is attended,
as was formerly <span class="nowrap">explained<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span>, with a
correspondent increase of injury. We
then increase the heat, but very slowly,
and taking a long time to bring the part
near its natural temperature, being regulated
by the progress which the part itself
is making; for the application of
heat may be considered in two points of
view, in this case; first, as the removal
of the injuring cause; and, secondly, as
a stimulus to action. If, then, the part
do not recover itself, in proportion to
the removal of the hurtful cause, but remain
stationary, it is evident that a farther
removal is at present useless, and the
stimulus which is consequently given is<span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>
highly dangerous. By these means,
then, we proceed slowly toward recovery,
and keep up the ground which we have
gained.</p>

<p>If, however, the action of the part have
been sunk very low, then recovery is impossible,
there being little or no energy,
and so little action, that it cannot increase
itself toward the natural state. In this
case, our endeavours must fail, and will
even kill the part sooner than if we had
let it alone; for the least increase of action
destroys the life of the part, which
may, in this case, be compared to a
dying taper, which gives one brighter
flash before it becomes for ever extinguished.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the action have
not originally been sunk so low as to
make the process toward death continue<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
progressively, but the remedies have been
applied too quickly, or, from any cause,
have failed to produce this effect, then
the action becomes inflammatory. The
pain becomes of a burning kind, there
is a feeling of pulsation, and the part becomes
redder, or livid, whereas, before, it
was bluish; from the stagnation of the
blood, there was no feeling of pulsation,
or arterial motion, and the sensation was
that of a painful cold and weight. The
inflammatio debilis is now induced, and
the danger is great, but still there is a
possibility of recovery, which is exactly
in proportion to the degree of previous
diminution of action, and to the rapidity
with which the subsequent inflammatory
action was induced, and the degree to
which it is raised; or, in other words,
the danger is proportioned to the disparity
betwixt the action and the power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span></p>

<p>The remedies for this disease are such
as tend to induce an action similar to the
natural one, by which we remove the
diseased one; for we know of none
which excite the natural action directly,
otherwise they would be of universal utility,
and would, in the present instance,
be preferred to every other. The remedies
which we employ with this intention,
are bark, opium, &amp;c. internally,
and vinous, or spiritous applications externally.
These, however, would be pernicious,
were there no inflammation present,
because they would, by exciting
action, tend to induce this; but, when,
the inflammatory action is once induced,
then, as they excite one more nearly resembling
the natural one, they are useful;
for, on the one hand, they destroy
the morbid one, and, on the other, increase
the power of recovery; but, for
this purpose, internal medicines, and good<span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>
diet, must be given, as a source whence
the energy is to be renewed, by the renewal
of the natural action. Heat is of
the most pernicious tendency in this
complaint; because it simply increases
the exciting action, and, therefore, makes
the inflammatory action still more violent.
The applications, therefore, ought
to be cold, as long as the morbid action
continues; but, when it is abating, and
recovery is going forward, they may be
made a little warmer, as they will thus
accelerate the healing process which is
taking place; but this requires much
prudence.</p>

<p>Spirit of wine is one of the best applications
in this disease, and is one very
generally employed. Camphor is frequently
added to it, and appears to increase
its efficacy. Pledgets dipped in
camphorated spirit of wine, and applied<span class="pagenum" title="231"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span>
to the part, will, if frequently renewed,
in many cases, remove the inflammation,
and prevent gangrene; but, in every instance,
it at least relieves the pain, which
uniformly returns, if, when the inflammation
is violent, we omit the application,
or use a weaker spirit, such as the
proof spirit.</p>

<p>Essential oils, particularly that of
turpentine, which is easiest procured, are
also useful, but are inferior to the alcohol.</p>

<p>Laudanum, in slight cases, is useful
as a topical application; but, if the inflammation
be more severe, it must be
mixed with rectified spirit. A very useful
application may be prepared by adding
two ounces of laudanum to a pound
of the spt. vin. camph. of the pharmacopœia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="232"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span></p>

<p>Internally, the bark must be exhibited
in full doses, with such a quantity
of wine as the feebleness of the pulse
points out; but we must be prudent in
this respect, because, if we give too
much, we may increase the local disease.
As long as it does not increase the pain,
or quicken the pulse, it is to be considered
as useful.</p>

<p>Opiates are extremely necessary in
the inflammatio debilis, and, in general,
require to be given freely.</p>

<p>Soups, and other articles of nourishing
diet, are absolutely requisite, and
ought to be given in small quantities at
a time, but frequently repeated.</p>

<p>By these means, we may frequently resolve
the inflammation completely; but,
at other times, when we have gained a<span class="pagenum" title="233"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span>
certain ground, the inflammation terminates
in the suppurative action; or, in
other words, when the parts have gained
more strength, and the action has come
more nearly to resemble the inflammatio
valida, which has continued for some
time, a similar termination takes place.
This event cannot, perhaps, in these
cases, be prevented, and, although it may
occasionally protract the cure, yet it diminishes
the danger, making mortification
less to be dreaded. The best treatment,
in these cases, perhaps, is to continue
our usual applications, avoiding
warm poultices until the action be fully
formed; then moderate heat may accelerate
the progress of the abscess toward
the surface. The same internal medicines
must be exhibited, the anodynes,
however, being gradually diminished as
the pain (which marks the necessity for
their use) abates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="234"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span></p>

<p>It too frequently, however, happens,
that either our remedies fail, or the proper
ones are not assiduously and judiciously
employed, in which case mortification
takes place. This requires the same
treatment, in whatever way it is induced,
only its progress is, from certain causes,
more <span class="nowrap">rapid<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> in one case than in another,
and, therefore, requires the more
free use of the appropriate remedies; but
the general principle is, in every case,
the same, and, therefore, I shall here consider
the disease indiscriminately, whether
it succeeds the inflammatio valida,
or debilis; because, in both instances,
the case is exactly the same, only, in the
first, the weakness which induces mortification,
is produced by the inflammation<span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
alone, whereas, in the second, it
existed to a great degree before the inflammation
was excited.</p>

<p>Mortification is to be prevented
from succeeding the inflammatio valida,
by timely bleeding, and the use of the
agentes dissimiles, by which we procure
resolution, or at least make the induction
of the purulent action more easy. In the
inflammatio debilis, it is to be prevented
by remedies of an opposite nature.</p>

<p>When, however, these remedies fail,
and mortification does take place, our
great object must be to prevent it from
extending far, and from injuring the
system. These intentions are answered
by the same remedies which cure the
inflammatio debilis; because the local
treatment of mortification is merely that
of the inflammatio debilis; for it is only<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
the parts which are still alive, or inflamed,
which can be acted on by our remedies.</p>

<p>The remedies are either general or
topical, and may be considered under
these divisions; but both must be used
at the same time.</p>

<p>Many of the older writers, proceeding
upon the humoural theories, began
their treatment of gangrene by bleeding
and purging, after which they prescribed
theriaca, and other stimulating applications.
Some modern authors still adhere,
in part, to this practice, and consider
the loss of blood to be advantageous
in cases of incipient gangrene. Mr. Bell,
who is one of the latest writers on this
subject, informs us, that, when the “general
symptoms of inflammation, particularly
a quick, full, or hard pulse,<span class="pagenum" title="237"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
still continue violent, and especially
when the patient is young and plethoric,
it then becomes absolutely necessary,
even although mortification
may have commenced, to empty the vessels
a little by one general blood-letting,”
which, “in such cases, may in reality be
considered as an antiseptic; and it does
often indeed, in this particular situation
of mortification, prove more powerfully
so, than all the different articles
in general enumerated as such.”
If, however, we consider the nature of
mortification, and the circumstances under
which it is most likely to occur, we
must look upon this practice as dangerous,
and must be permitted to doubt whether
the full hard pulse is to be met with after
the commencement of inflammation,
or whether the symptoms of the inflammatio
valida, (in which alone bleeding is
admissible) still continue violent, after one<span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>
portion of the inflamed part is evidently
gangrenous. Is it reasonable to suppose
that one portion of the inflamed part shall
be already dead, or dying, and that yet the
rest shall not have begun to suffer? or that
the action shall not have become converted
into the inflammatio debilis, (if it were
not originally this)? This surely is not
the time for bleeding, purging, and debilitating
remedies; but the part must
be considered as possessing the low inflammatory
action, and the patient as requiring
suitable remedies. It may indeed
be said by some, in favour of bleeding,
that the bark, in some instances,
does not check the progress of the disease;
but it surely does not thence follow,
that it does positive injury, and that
remedies of an opposite nature are useful.</p>

<p>The Peruvian bark is, in many cases,<span class="pagenum" title="239"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
one of the most useful internal remedies.
It was originally introduced into medicine,
about one hundred and fifty years
ago, as a cure for intermittent fever;
and its utility in gangrene is said to
have been discovered by its curing this
disease in a person who had it combined
with ague, and who was taking
the bark on account of the latter complaint.
For many years after it was
known in Europe, great prejudices prevailed
amongst physicians against its use,
partly on account of its having been improperly
administered, but still more because
it was so unfortunate as to cure
diseases without necessarily either sweating
or purging the patient, a fact which
could be only ill explained, or rather
scarcely allowed to be possible, by the
prevailing theories of physic. Accordingly,
although the cases in which it had
been successful were by no means a se<span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span>cret,
and although severals had the courage
to employ it, in spite of all speculative
arguments, yet neither Dr. Boerrhave,
nor his commentator, Van Swieten,
thought it expedient either to recommend
or prescribe it. Renewing the
motion of the stagnating blood by venesection,
and the exhibition of trifling remedies,
which could scarcely be called
cordial, although sometimes dignified
with that epithet, together with the external
application of ardent spirits, or oil
of turpentine, constituted the current
practice in gangrene. These prejudices
against the bark, which originated in ignorance,
and were supported by attention
to a foolish theory, continued long; but
the want of a better remedy began at last
to make them gradually give way, and
the success of empyrics who used the
bark soon completed their downfal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span></p>

<p>The bark induces an action nearly similar
to the natural one, which is greatly
injured, and, therefore, it gives a check
to the progress of the disease; but, if its
operation be not assisted by nourishment,
&amp;c. its good effects soon subside, because
the materials whence new energy can be
drawn are withheld, and, therefore, the
system cannot profit so much by the establishment
of the new action, and by the
restoration of the power of converting the
vital principle of foreign matter into nervous
energy. The bark, then, is of service
in two points of view: First, it
changes directly the action of the system,
it induces, in a considerable degree, an
action somewhat similar to the natural
action, and, therefore, counteracts the general
action of descent which was taking
place. Secondly, by inducing this action,
it, to a certain degree, produces the
same effects for a time which would have<span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>
been produced by the natural action itself,
or increases the power of renewing
vitality; for, in the preliminary dissertation,
it was mentioned, that the production
of energy was exactly proportioned
to the perfection and healthiness of the
existing action. The good effects of
bark, then, cannot be obtained without
nourishment and free air.</p>

<p>It uniformly happens, however, that,
in many instances, where the action of
the bark would be most beneficial, it is
impossible to induce it, owing to several
causes, but particularly to its effect on
the stomach; for, in many instances, it
produces sickness, or nausea, in which
case it can do no good, and ought to be
abandoned. Momentary sickness, after
taking a dose of bark, is indeed a very
general effect, and does not materially injure
its operation; but, whenever it is<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
either frequently vomited, or produces a
sickness of considerable duration, it must
either be given in smaller quantities, or
in a different form, or at longer intervals;
or if all of these fail, it must be laid aside
completely, because it not only cannot
produce its specific effect, but will even
injure the remaining powers by its effect
upon the stomach.</p>

<p>The best form in which bark can be
prescribed is that of powder, which is
more effectual than any tincture, or the
extracts. This ought to be exhibited in as
great quantity as the stomach will bear,
which cannot be reduced to any certain
scale. In general, an adult ought, if possible,
to take half a drachm, or two scruples,
every forty minutes, in the most palatable
vehicle; for much depends upon
the taste, owing to the sympathy betwixt
the mouth and the stomach; and, for<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
this reason, the same vehicle ought seldom
to be used more than twice in immediate
succession; because, by changing
the vehicle, we not only change the
taste, which has a tendency to prevent
loathing, but also modify the immediate
action on the stomach, changing, to a
certain degree, the former impression,
which was perhaps beginning to produce
sickness. Lemon juice and water, the
different kinds of wines, punch, pimento,
cinnamon, and peppermint waters, milk,
rose water, beer, &amp;c. afford us a variation
which may be usefully employed.</p>

<p>The tincture and watery infusion of
the bark, either separately or mixed together,
are frequently employed, when
the powder is vomited; but, as they
must be given in very considerable quantities,
in order to produce any good effect,
they are very apt to produce sick<span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>ness,
and are likewise so inferior in power
to the powder, that they are very little to
be trusted.</p>

<p>The extract with resin, is a better
form than the tincture, or infusion; and,
where the powder is rejected, may be
made into pills.</p>

<p>When the stomach rejects every form
and preparation, it has been proposed to
give the bark in clysters, and this ought
certainly to be done rather than lose the
effects of the remedy; but, given in this
way, its effects are more uncertain. From
two drachms to half an ounce of the
powder of bark, may be diffused in three
ounces of soup, or mucilage, with fifteen
or twenty drops of laudanum, and given
as an enema. This must be repeated at
least every hour and a half, or two hours,<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>
until the stomach can retain the medicine.</p>

<p>The wine is very usefully conjoined
with the bark, and is even of considerable
use by itself, when the bark is rejected.
Its operation is more speedy than
that of the bark, but it is perhaps more
fugacious. The quantity which is necessary
to be given depends upon the effect
of the local disease upon the system, and
on the inability to bear other remedies.
A table spoonful may be given in general
every quarter of an hour, unless it
increase the pain, and frequency of pulse,
and produce restlessness, and heat of the
skin. In these circumstances, we may
be certain that we have increased the
quantity beyond the <span class="nowrap">necessity<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="247"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span></p>
<p>Opium is likewise an useful remedy in
this disease, and ought never to be omitted;
because it not only diminishes the
irritability, and, consequently, the pain,
but likewise, like the wine and the bark,
counteracts, by the induction of its peculiar
action, the progress of the inflammatio
debilis, and, consequently, tends
to check the mortification. This medicine
is most usefully exhibited in full
doses, which not only procure ease, but
also frequently make the stomach more
readily bear other remedies. One grain
of the extract, or twenty-five drops of
the tincture, may be given at once, and
the dose repeated whenever the action of
the former subsides. After some time,
each dose must be increased one half,<span class="pagenum" title="248"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span>
and presently doubled, in order to produce
the same effect as it did at first.</p>

<p>These remedies may give a temporary
check to the disease; but, unless nourishment
be conjoined, in every possible
form, they will not of themselves be able
to effect a cure, if the disease be tedious.
Soups, jellies, milk, sago, &amp;c. must be
assiduously given in small quantities, and
even thrown up as clysters, if the stomach
cannot bear them.</p>

<p>Vegetable acids, fixed air, wort, &amp;c.
have been recommended in this disease,
probably upon the supposition of the
existence of a putrescent matter, or from
their utility in scurvy. Wort, however,
and fixed air, do not appear to be of
very great benefit in this disease, at least
they are by no means to be put in competition
with other remedies of more approved<span class="pagenum" title="249"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>
efficacy, or allowed to interfere
with their exhibition. The acid of lemons
seems to be more generally useful
than the carbonic acid; and, perhaps,
the nitrous acid would be equally useful
with the citric acid. These acids do not
operate by counteracting putrefaction,
but by counteracting the action of descent,
inducing a more healthy action,
and tending to excite ulceration, which
is the mean employed for separating the
dead part, and producing restoration.
For this purpose, however, the acids must
be given freely, otherwise no good is
done.</p>

<p>The local treatment is to be conducted
on the same principle as in the cure
of the inflammatio debilis. Pledgets,
dipped in the oil of turpentine, tincture
of myrrh, or rather in camphorated spirit
of wine, which is one of the best applications<span class="pagenum" title="250"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a></span>
which can be used, ought to
be made use of.</p>

<p>These remedies can do little service
when applied to the dead portion; but,
as the whole part does not die at once,
there are always some portions which
are still in the inflamed state, and on
which they act. They likewise prevent
the progress of the disease, by operating
on the skin which is contiguous to the
gangrene. Every mortification, in general,
attacks the skin first; or, in other
words, the inflammatio debilis spreads
faster along the skin than along the
deeper parts; but, when once the skin
is inflamed, and mortifies, the disease
extends to a greater or less depth below
the surface. Whatever, then, operates
on the surface, and prevents the progress
of the inflammation, or cures the part
which is already inflamed, will tend to<span class="pagenum" title="251"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span>
check the extension of the disease, especially
if the proper internal remedies be
made use of with a view to prevent the
extension of the action of descent.</p>

<p>Formerly, in order to allow these
remedies to come in contact with the
living parts, it was customary to make
incisions through the dead portion, and
not unfrequently through part of the
living substance. But, as these cannot
prevent the extension of the disease over
a greater surface, and, as the irritation
which is given, and the exposure of parts
which have not yet assumed the ulcerative
action, tend to increase the inflammatio
debilis, the practice must be considered
as <span class="nowrap">improper<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span>. It is now indeed<span class="pagenum" title="252"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span>
almost universally laid aside, owing, in
a great measure, to the observations of
the ingenious Mr. Pott.</p>

<p>Antiseptics, such as decoction of
camomile flowers, &amp;c. have been recommended
as external applications; but,
whatever effects they may have on the
matter which is already dead, it is evident
that they can be of no service in
preserving the living parts from suffering
death. All that can be expected from
them is to check the putrefaction of the
dead substance, which they have very
little power to do; and, therefore, they
can never come into competition with
more valuable remedies, such as the camphorated
spirit of wine, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When, by the use of the remedies already
mentioned, the progress of the gangrene
is stopped, the ulcerative action is<span class="pagenum" title="253"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span>
induced in the part immediately adjoining
to the dead portion, and a red line
of separation appears. By means of this
ulcerative action, which takes place in
every point where the mortification stops,
the dead part is separated from the living,
and comes away as soon as the
bonds of dead muscular fibres, tendons,
&amp;c. which unite them, are destroyed by
putrefaction. When this separation takes
place, or when it is advanced so far as to
permit us to accelerate it by dividing the
loose tendons, &amp;c. the exposed part must
be dressed as an ulcer, or wrapped up in
a poultice of the same temperature with
the human body.</p>

<p>If, however, the disease have penetrated
deep, and destroyed the limb so
much as to render it impossible to cure
it, or useless, if it were possible, then amputation
must be performed; but this,<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span>
whatever desire the patient may express,
must not be practised until the mortification
be fully stopped, and the ulcerative
action induced; because, if performed
sooner, the mortification seizes the stump,
and the patient is quickly killed. The
system is likewise in such a state as to
be unable to sustain the action which is
necessarily produced by the operation.
It is even improper to cut too near the
diseased portion; because the parts here,
although the mortification be stopped,
are so weakened, that they are less apt
to unite. The vessels often break out
soon after they are tied, and a new mortification
is by no means an unlikely occurrence.
Even when the amputation is
performed pretty far up the limb, the
corners of the stump frequently mortify,
or become livid; but a few doses of
bark and wine stop the progress of the
disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span></p>

<p>Although it is a general rule that
amputation is necessary whenever the
member is so destroyed as to become
useless, and although this must not be
performed until the ulcerative action be
induced, yet it must not invariably be
performed whenever this action takes
place, because sometimes at this period
the patient is unable to sustain the general
action which the operation would produce.
We must, therefore, if the patient
be much reduced by the extent, or
long continuance of the disease, rather
delay until, by good diet, wine, &amp;c. we
have procured an increase of strength;
but, if we find that either the patient
loses ground, or his weakness remains
stationary under this treatment, we must
then amputate; because, it is probable,
that the continuance of the dead portion
in contact with the living is tending to<span class="pagenum" title="256"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
induce still the general action of <span class="nowrap">descent<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="257"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span></p>
<p>When we do not deem it adviseable
to amputate very soon after the induction
of the ulcerative action, it is sometimes
useful to cut off part of the black
mortified portion, or perhaps to remove a
joint, by cutting through the remaining
ligaments. In this way, we lessen the
fœtor, and make the patient more comfortable.</p>

<p>After making these observations on
mortification, I shall conclude with the
following case:</p>

<p>A young woman, who lived at a considerable
distance from Glasgow, was, in
May 1797, seized with erysipelas of the<span class="pagenum" title="258"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>
right foot and leg, which, by her account,
had been extremely violent, and
very much neglected. On the tenth day
of the disease she was brought to town,
and admitted into the hospital. The
foot was quite cold, the leg livid, and
extremely painful. Pledgets dipped in
camphorated spirit of wine were applied
to the parts, and bark, wine, and opium,
were prescribed, together with oranges,
&amp;c. and gradually increased in quantity,
until at last she came to drink, besides
soup, a couple of bottles of wine
daily, at the same time that she took
eight grains of opium, and a very considerable
quantity of bark, in the twenty-four
hours. By these means, the pulse
was soon brought down from one hundred
and forty to one hundred and eighteen
strokes in the minute; but it was
not until twenty days after her admission<span class="pagenum" title="259"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span>
that the ulcerative action was evidently
induced. The quantity of the
medicine was now gradually diminished;
and, in a few days more, the separation
being complete, the limb was amputated
above the knee. During the operation,
I paid particular attention to the saving
of blood; and the circulation being destroyed
in the parts below the knee,
there was scarcely any lost. At this
time, she was still taking a bottle of
wine, with a considerable quantity of
bark and opium, daily. The wine was
omitted after the operation; but she had
a drachm of laudanum, and continued to
take the bark. In the evening the same
quantity of laudanum was repeated. Next
day she was quite easy, and had slept
well; the pulse beat only one hundred
in the minute. On the third day the
stump was dressed, when it was found<span class="pagenum" title="260"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span>
(as was to be <span class="nowrap">expected<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span>), that only a
very imperfect adhesion had taken place:
One of the corners was also livid. The
bark was therefore freely continued, and
six ounces of wine added daily; but the
pulse having, on the fifth day, risen to
one hundred and ten, and the spot becoming
of a darker colour, she was allowed<span class="pagenum" title="261"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
a pound of wine, which made the
pulse fall, and soon produced a separation
of a small slough. In a short time
she went to the country cured. During
the whole period of the cure, the opium
and wine which she took produced neither
stupor, nor the slightest appearance
of intoxication. I at one time, when the
pain had for a couple of days been moderate,
was willing to ascertain the effects
of a milder preparation than the
camphorated spirit, and substituted proof
spirit in its place; but, in an hour, it
was obliged to be renewed, the pain
having greatly increased.</p>


<h3><i>Of the Treatment of the Inflammatio Assuefacta.</i></h3>

<p>After the inflammatio valida has continued
for a considerable time, if neither<span class="pagenum" title="262"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span>
suppuration, nor any other termination be
induced, it is very apt to be converted
into the state which has been called passive
inflammation, or which, on account
of its most frequent cause, I have called
the inflammatio assuefacta. This action
is, in several respects, different from the
acute inflammation, and resembles it
only in its general appearance. It may
therefore, in one respect, be considered
as a termination of inflammation, being,
strictly speaking, a new action, or spurious
inflammation.</p>

<p>This action succeeds the acute inflammation,
sooner or later, in different
places; and, when once induced, each
succeeding inflammation of the same
part is apt very quickly to terminate in
the same condition; or, if the renewal
of the inflammation be very frequent,<span class="pagenum" title="263"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span>
this is at last induced without any previous
acute inflammation.</p>

<p>A state somewhat similar to this, if
not exactly the same, precedes acute inflammation,
as well as follows it; for,
during the period which intervenes betwixt
the first formation of the action
and its perfection, the part remains in
this state. We can sometimes observe
the augmentation and diminution of the
redness and pain during the systole and
diastole of the arteries; and, by the use
of the same remedies which cure the inflammatio
assuefacta, we can sometimes
prevent the farther progress of the disease.</p>

<p>Thus, pepper boiled in milk, is frequently
used by the country people as a
cure for cynanche, during its incipient
stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="264"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span></p>

<p>Bleeding, saturnine applications, and
the other remedies which are useful in
the inflammatio valida et acuta, are hurtful
here, and increase the disease.</p>

<p>The agentes similes, on the contrary,
are useful, and may be used internally,
or topically.</p>

<p>Internally, the bark, wine, and
opium, with good diet, ought always to
be employed, if the part affected be very
delicate, and sympathise greatly with
the constitution, or if the extent of the
disease be great.</p>

<p>Locally, stimulating applications are
the proper remedies; and the strength
and nature of these must depend upon
the natural or acquired delicacy of the
part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="265"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span></p>

<p>When the skin, or cellular substance,
is affected with the inflammatio assuefacta,
spirit of wine by itself, or with
the addition of a little camphor, is a very
useful application.</p>

<p>When the skin is not directly affected,
but only the parts immediately below
it, as, for instance, the muscles in
chronic rheumatism, or the articulating
surfaces of joints, we may sometimes, by
applying cloths dipped in laudanum, or
strong diffusion of opium, propagate,
from the surface to a certain distance,
the narcotic action, and alleviate the disease;
but, most frequently, we are obliged
to trust entirely to the effect of the
sympathy of equilibrium, diminishing
the action of the internal parts, without
any considerable change of nature, by
increasing that of the surface. Blisters
and rubefacients, such as volatile lina<span class="pagenum" title="266"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a></span>mentol.
terebrinth. cum camphora, &amp;c.
are the remedies for this purpose.</p>

<p>The inflammatio assuefacta, when it
affects delicate parts, covered only with
a thin skin, such as the throat, forming
one of the most frequent species of cynanche,
is cured by gargling with port
wine, infusion of capsicum, and similar
remedies.</p>

<p>When it affects the eyes, the use of
stimulating and opiated preparations have
been long in use. The following is one
of the best:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
R.&ensp;Vini Albi uncias duas.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Opii drachmam.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Pulv. Gall. scrupulum. Macera per dies tres dein cola.
</p>

<p>A drop or two of this may be let fall
into the eye three times a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="267"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></span></p>

<p>Electricity is recommended in the
cure of this kind of inflammation; but
this, as well as heat, are doubtful remedies;
for both seem to increase actions
without changing them, except in so far
as the change depends upon an increased
degree. Cold, on the other hand, lessens
the power of recovery, if carried to any
great degree; but, when slight, it assists
the operation of other remedies, by lessening
the performance of the existing
action, which is morbid. All applications,
therefore, ought in general to be a
little below the temperature of the part.</p>

<p>Whenever an inflammation does not
manifest a tendency to any other termination,
but continues stationary, or perhaps
becomes worse, under the use of
the remedies which we employ for the
cure of the inflammatio valida, we may
consider that this action (or the inflammatio<span class="pagenum" title="268"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a></span>
assuefacta) has taken place, and
that the nature of our applications must
be changed. Bark and wine, with anodynes,
may be given internally, whilst,
if the situation of the part permit, suitable
applications must be made to it. By
continuing this treatment, we frequently
resolve the inflammatio assuefacta; but,
occasionally, it becomes again converted
into the true acute inflammation, in
which case the continuance of the same
remedies will do hurt. The appropriate
local remedies, such as cold, saturnine
preparations, &amp;c. must be had recourse
to, if the part be external, whilst, if the
pulse become hard, and more frequent,
or fuller, general remedies, such as bleeding
in small quantity, may be useful;
but both local and general remedies must
be used with moderation, and pushed
only a certain length, otherwise we defeat
our intention, and again speedily induce<span class="pagenum" title="269"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a></span>
the inflammatio assuefacta, by interfering
with the powers of recovery.
If this happen, we must again have recourse
to the proper remedies.</p>

<h2>DISSERTATION III.</h2>
</div>


<h3><i>On the Phagedenic, and some other Species
of Specific Inflammation.</i></h3>

<p>When any peculiar modification of
the inflammatory action takes place, specific
inflammation is said to be produced;
that is to say, the action possesses some
peculiar or specific qualities, independent
of the simple condition of inflammation;
and these are generally productive of
evident and visible effects, which are characteristic
of their presence; but, until
these effects, which are chiefly observable
in the appearance of the consequent ulceration,
appear, it is frequently impossible,
from the symptoms of the inflammation<span class="pagenum" title="271"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a></span>
alone, to say that it is specific;
because the evident effects, or symptoms
of the inflammatory action, such as heat,
pain, redness, &amp;c. admit of few specific
alterations, varying only in degree, and
this variation taking place often without
any specific affection of the <span class="nowrap">action<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span>.</p>

<p>The effects of the ulcerative action
admit of greater variations than those of
the inflammatory, and, therefore, more
readily show the presence of specific action.
The healthy ulcerative action exhibits
certain appearances which have
been already described, and which are
easily known. The simple deviations
which have been treated of, in considering<span class="pagenum" title="272"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a></span>
the different genera of ulcers, are
also discoverable by the effects, or peculiar
symptoms. The specific deviations
dependent upon the presence of previous
specific inflammation, or the application
of a morbid agent, after simple ulceration
has been induced, may also, in many
cases, be detected and ascertained, by
the variations which take place in the
aspect of the sore, the appearance of
the granulations, discharge, &amp;c.; but
these variations and appearances consist
so much in peculiar hues and qualities
of the granulations, which we have no
words to convey an idea of, that it is
impossible to give an accurate description
of a specific sore, but must see it in order
to obtain an idea of it. We may indeed
say, that a sore is ragged, has a fiery
look, is surrounded with an erysipelatous
margin, and discharges a thin fœtid
matter, but still we shall not convey the<span class="pagenum" title="273"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a></span>
idea of the specific appearance of the
ulcer.</p>

<p>It is this specific appearance alone
which characterises a specific ulcer; and
this, in each peculiar ulcer, is different;
and a knowledge of it can only be obtained
by an attentive examination of
many sores. On this account, it is extremely
difficult, in many instances, to
distinguish a specific ulcer, because the
discrimination depends altogether upon
the recollection of the practitioner, and
the improvement which he has made of
his former observations. It is indeed, it
may be thought, an easy matter to distinguish
a simple ulcer by negative characters,
or the want of the peculiar aspect;
but, as this aspect is very arbitrary,
and as the appearance of simple
ulcers is, as has been already described,
very various, it is difficult to say, without<span class="pagenum" title="274"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a></span>
much judgment, whether the sore be simple
or specific; for the appearance of the
one and of the other run imperceptibly
into each other. Even if it be ascertained
to be specific, it is difficult often to
distinguish betwixt particular specific diseases,
in so much, that many are forced
to take mercury for the cure of syphilis,
who never had that disease.</p>

<p>Besides the appearance of the sores,
specific action likewise produces a perceptible
effect upon the scab which covers
them, or the cicatrix which is formed.
Thus, scrophula is marked by a particular
appearance of the cicatrix, or of the
scab. The venereal ulcer has likewise a
particular scab, and many cutaneous ulcers
are best distinguished by the scab.
Other actions produce no considerable ulceration,
but only successive desquamation
of the cuticle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="275"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></span></p>

<p>We may also sometimes discover specific
action by the sensation of which the
action is productive. Thus, for instance,
cancer produces a burning kind of pain,
which never attends simple ulceration.</p>

<p>Specific ulceration is also always surrounded
with more or less simple inflammation,
or erysipelas, of the surrounding
skin. In some cases the margin is hard,
in others ragged, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It were much to be wished, that some
more certain, and less arbitrary criteria,
than those which we possess of the presence
of specific action could be discovered;
but, as yet, we know of no other
which can be applied universally. Some
kinds, indeed, are so well marked, and
so peculiarly distinguished from simple
sores, that they can be tolerably well described,
and easily discovered to be spe<span class="pagenum" title="276"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a></span>cific;
but, there are others which it is
more difficult to ascertain, owing to the
difficulty of fixing the character of each
individual action.</p>

<p>The number of specific inflammations
is very great, and the causes which produce
them are often obscure. In the preliminary
dissertation it was mentioned,
that, whenever any action existed strongly
in any one part, it tended to induce
an inflammatory state. There are, therefore,
no general, or febrile diseases, which
may not be attended with peculiar inflammations.
That typhus fever is attended
with local inflammatory action is
pretty certain; but the presence of specific
inflammation is still more evidently
seen in the different exanthematous diseases.
The diseases called cutaneous, afford
us also numerous instances of specific
inflammation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="277"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a></span></p>

<p>From the difficulty of discriminating
betwixt diseases, which, although essentially
different from each other, yet possess
a very great similarity, we find, that
the number of specific inflammations is
confined much within the true limits;
for we find many confounded under the
name of herpetic, &amp;c. which are radically
different from each other.</p>

<p>Phagedena has been used by medical
writers in a very extensive sense,
and has been made to comprehend diseases,
which, strictly speaking, cannot be
considered phagedenic.</p>

<p>The phagedena is a suppurating sore,
dependent upon the application of a peculiar
contagion. No granulations are
formed, but both sets of vessels yield a
thin fluid. The surface of the sore has
a jagged appearance, dependent upon the<span class="pagenum" title="278"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></span>
irregularity of the absorption, and not
upon the deposition of organic particles,
or granulations. The colour of the surface
is dark, but clear, or fiery. The
surrounding integuments are erysipelatous.
The discharge is thin and serous,
and the pain considerable. This is divisible
into two varieties: First, the true
phagedenic, which does not go deeper
than the skin, but spreads rapidly along
the surface. This kind frequently stops
in its progress suddenly, and skins over
as fast as it spread. Second, the noma,
or penetrating phagedena, which extends
deeply, penetrating sometimes perpendicularly
down through the cellular substance
to the muscular fascia; at other
times, proceeding more irregularly, penetrating
deeper at one part than another,
and having its margins ending less
abruptly in the neighbouring skin. This
never cicatrizes rapidly; but, sometimes,<span class="pagenum" title="279"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></span>
when the sore assumes a healing appearance,
it suddenly becomes again diseased,
and a considerable portion sloughs off.
The alternation of proceeding a certain
length in the cure, and relapsing, is frequently
repeated, and often renders the
disease very tedious.</p>

<p>The best application for the common
phagedena is an ointment consisting of
an ounce of ung. resinos. and a drachm
of red precipitate.</p>

<p>The application of caustic to the surface
also frequently stops the progress of
the disease.</p>

<p>The hepatized ammonia, much diluted,
is also very useful as a lotion.</p>

<p>The penetrating phagedena is more
difficult to cure; for, even after the diseased<span class="pagenum" title="280"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a></span>
action is removed, the ulcer remains
in an irritable, or overacting date.
The application which I have found
most useful is powdered opium, mixed
with simple ointment, in the proportion
of two drachms of the former to an
ounce of the latter. After the phagedenic
action ceases, the sore must be treated
according to the genus of simple ulcer
to which it belongs.</p>

<p>When the sores seem to pursue their ravages
obstinately, the most effectual mean
of stopping their progress (until we discover
a specific remedy, or one which can
change the nature of the action), is to
apply the caustic to every part, and so
freely, as to produce a pretty thick
slough. Whenever this appears to separate,
precipitate must be applied, in order,
if possible, to prevent the recurrence
of the diseased action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="281"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></span></p>

<p>When any considerable vessel is eroded,
by the continuance of this disease, it
must be tied beyond the diseased part;
but we must be careful that no matter
from the sore gets upon the wound, otherwise
it will become diseased also. I
have a preparation, in which a part
of the femoral artery was opened at
the groin by this kind of sore, which
succeeded a venereal bubo. No operation,
I understand, was attempted, but
compression alone used. The man died
in a short time. Whether tying the
iliac artery, by cutting through Poupart’s
ligament, would have saved him,
is difficult to say.</p>

<p>The true phagedena seems always to
confine its action to a particular <span class="nowrap">spot<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span>;<span class="pagenum" title="282"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a></span>
but many of these diseases, which have
been described under the same name,
appear to be capable of inducing a general
action, similar to the venereal disease,
affecting different parts of the body in
succession. A case of this kind is related
by Mr. Adams, in his Observations on
Morbid Poisons: A gentleman who had
a small pustule on the prepuce, squeezed
it so as to make it burst, and soon afterwards
had connection with a woman
whom he had long known. The sore
remaining without healing, he applied a
solution of caustic, and had recourse to
mercurial frictions. But, notwithstanding
these, the ulcer spread, and soon
reached the scrotum. The mercury was
now laid aside, and bark, with a good
diet, were substituted, after which the ulcer
put on a healing appearance; but, before
cicatrization took place, a feverish fit
supervened, with violent pain in the part.<span class="pagenum" title="283"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a></span>
In the course of a short time, however, the
unfavourable symptoms disappeared, and
a healthy condition was again apparently
induced. These paroxysms of fever, and
subsequent amendment, alternated with
each other for a considerable time, and
each relapse was preceded by a livid appearance
round the sore. These appearances
at last went off, and the sore assumed
more the aspect of the true phagedena.
The cicatrizing process now began
at the upper part, and proceeded rapidly
until almost the whole sore was covered.
But, nearly about this time, copper
coloured spots appeared on the hands,
and the inside of the right thigh; and,
in a day or two afterwards, an ulcer appeared
in the throat, with “bumps” on
the head. Shortly afterwards a node
appeared on the tibia, and the patient
became bandy. The blotches speedily
began to ulcerate, and another appeared<span class="pagenum" title="284"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a></span>
on the sternum. Mercury was now
given freely, and at first with apparent
success, for the ulcers looked better, and
no new affection appeared; but, whenever
the mercurial action was beginning
to be fully induced, the granulating appearance
of the surface was destroyed,
and it became of a dusky colour, discharging
“bloody sanies.” The bones
remained stationary. The medicine was
now discontinued, and the patient went
to the country; but, on his return, in
about a fortnight, “his throat was again
<span class="nowrap">ulcerated<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span>. Such of the old external
ulcers as had not healed, threw up a
kind of fungus granulations.” The
sore on the penis, which never had been
completely well, had spread to the size
of a shilling, but had no phagedenic, or<span class="pagenum" title="285"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a></span>
specific appearance. Mercury was afterwards
tried, and some bones exfoliated
from the nose. The ulcer healed; but,
as soon as he recovered from the effects
of the mercury, new blotches and ulcerations,
with a new enlargement of the tibia,
took place. “He is now under his
fifth mercurial course.”</p>

<p>In this case, mercury evidently was
prejudicial, except toward the end. It
does not appear that the caustic had been
freely applied to the original local disease,
which might have destroyed it.
These affections, which were by some
considered as venereal, evidently differed
from that disease, in the rapidity of its
progress, in the appearance of the primary
sore, and in the history of the
whole of the symptoms. We are as yet
in the dark with regard to a specific remedy
for these, and similar affections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="286"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a></span></p>

<p>There are several other ulcers, which
appear upon the penis after coition,
which probably depend upon the application
of a peculiar contagion. <span class="nowrap">These<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span>
are sometimes superficial and phagedenic;
they spread fast, and heal rapidly,
frequently in the course of a night after
precipitate has been applied. At other
times they are deeper, and more like a
little cup; the surface is smooth and
glossy, without any appearance of granulations;
the discharge is thin, and the
base and margin quite soft. The best
remedy is the caustic, with the subsequent
application, precipitate, or ung.
hyd. nit. dilut. When buboes form, I
have always found them heal without<span class="pagenum" title="287"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a></span>
the use of mercury. If, however, the
bubo be the first symptom which appears,
as is sometimes the case, (for the
morbid agent is occasionally absorbed
before it excites action in the part to
which it is applied), then it is generally
much more difficult to heal than
when it is preceded by a local action,
and induced by the absorption of matter
generated there.</p>

<p>If these local, or primary symptoms,
be not speedily removed, a general disease
is induced, as we see in the case already
mentioned, and as is proved by
numberless other instances. These general
affections are marked by ulcerations
of different parts; and the ulcers have a
different appearance, according to the nature
of the morbid agent. In some cases
they are better and worse at intervals.
Mercury has, in almost all these cases,<span class="pagenum" title="288"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a></span>
been used; but, although some are ameliorated
by it, yet others resist its action.
At first, indeed, they generally appear to
heal; for the mercurial action, when
forming, interrupts the progress of the
former diseased action; but, whenever
the mercurial action is fully induced, we
sometimes find that the appearances
change, and the progress generally becomes
quicker than <span class="nowrap">formerly<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="289"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></span></p>
<p>There is a disease which is not unfrequently
confounded with syphilis, but
which is distinct from it; I mean small
ulcers about the mouths of children,
which are more like aphthæ than any
thing else; but, soon after their appearance,
small blotches appear in the body,
which become first raised into a little
flat vesicle, and then ulcerate superficially.
These ulcers have a watery appearance,
not much unlike tetters; but
the appearance of the vesication, and dark
colour of the preceding blotches, prevent
any confusion. Nurses who suckle these
children have generally small calyciform
ulcers on the nipples, of a pale colour,
and discharging a thin watery mat<span class="pagenum" title="290"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a></span>ter.
I have had no opportunity of ascertaining
what constitutional symptoms
would be produced by the continuance
of the disease in the nurse, as I have generally
found that the application of diluted
citrine ointment to the nipple produced
a cure, without any internal medicine.
The constitutional symptoms in
the children were cured by the same local
applications, with small doses of calomel
<span class="nowrap">internally<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span>.</p>

<p>I have likewise observed ulcers on the
lips, throat, and mouth, which at first
had a very doubtful appearance; but
they evidently are distinct from syphilis,
and belong to the suppurating sores.
When superficial, the buff-coloured matter,
or inorganised substance which covers<span class="pagenum" title="291"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a></span>
them, has a fibrous, or thready appearance,
the margins are slightly tumid,
and of a florid, or kind of pink colour.
The application of caustic, or burnt
alum, is often sufficient of itself to
cure these; but small doses of mercury
sometimes accelerate the cure. At
other times these sores penetrate deeper,
and affect the bones. The surface,
which is deep, is covered with a thick
yellow slough, like an overacting ulcer.
The margins are tumid, ragged, and of
a light, or pink colour. Sometimes the
disease spreads along the gum, which
becomes soft, ulcerated, and separates
from the teeth, which very frequently
become black, and, when the sockets are
affected, drop out. I have not had an
opportunity of observing these sores go
the length of inducing constitutional
symptoms. It is not easy to ascertain
the cause of these sores; sometimes they<span class="pagenum" title="292"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a></span>
succeed the use of mercury; but, at other
times, it is impossible to blame any
evident agent. The transplanting of
teeth sometimes has been the mean of
inducing sores similar to these; and, in
these cases, the disease has generally passed
for <span class="nowrap">syphilis<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span>. But although the venereal
disease may have been inoculated
in this manner, it is certain, from the
appearance of the ulcers, from their rapid
progress, and from the sudden effect
produced by a very small quantity of
mercury, that the disease, which is commonly
induced by transplanting teeth, is
not syphilitic.</p>

<p>Sibbens is another disease which has
been very frequently confounded with
syphilis, and is by many considered to be<span class="pagenum" title="293"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a></span>
only a variety of that disease; but they evidently
are different, as appears from the
mode of infection, and the properties of
the <span class="nowrap">contagion<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span>, the appearance of the
ulcers, their progress, and certain circumstances
in their cure, particularly their
requiring less mercury than venereal ulcers
in the same state, and from their
yielding readily to preparations of mercury,
which do not accomplish a cure of
syphilis.</p>

<p>This disease appears first on the part
which is most directly acted on by the
contagion. This part becomes red and
inflamed, having an erysipelatous appear<span class="pagenum" title="294"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a></span>ance.
Ulceration quickly takes place on
a particular spot, and spreads rapidly
along the whole inflamed part. The
disease then advances more slowly; the
erysipelatous appearance spreads around
the margin of the ulcer, and ulceration
follows upon the inflammation. In the
course of some time (the precise period
is not fixed), the skin becomes affected
with blotches, or sometimes clusters of
small pustules, the intervening space betwixt
each being affected with an erysipelatous
inflammation. These spots soon
ulcerate, and the surface rises up into a
fungous, which is irregular, and has an
aspect somewhat betwixt the look of the
venereal sore and a very bad scrophulous
ulcer. The bones next become affected,
particularly at the articulating surfaces,
which swell, and become carious. It is said
that the secondary ulcers in general appear
first upon the genitals; but, of all those<span class="pagenum" title="295"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a></span>
whom I have examined, no affection of
these parts had taken place, from which
I would infer, that the disease has no
peculiar tendency to affect these in preference
to other parts. It is likewise said
that the disease sometimes disappears
from one part, whilst it breaks out in another;
but this also I have never witnessed.
The primary ulcers also have no
tendency, like some others, to change
their appearance, and become milder, or
heal by continuance, but spread, destroying
the nose, orbits of the eyes, and face.
The constitution seems to suffer much
more from this disease than from syphilis,
in the same length of time; for the
patient soon assumes a pale sallow look;
and hectic comes on much sooner than
in syphilis.</p>

<p>The cure of this disease is effected by
washing the sores with solution of corrosive<span class="pagenum" title="296"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a></span>
sublimate, or dressing them with
precipitate ointment, at the same time
that we use mercury internally, without
which no escharotic, or local application
whatever will effect a cure. In general,
less mercury cures this disease than syphilis;
and it is worthy of remark, that
permanent cures may be obtained by the
hyd. mur. corros. which is not the case
with syphilis. When the bones are affected,
we must, in conjunction with the
specific remedy, use such applications as
the state of the bone, considered as a simple
affection, will require.</p>

<p>The cynanche maligna, and scarlatina,
are also diseases producing ulceration in
the throat. The sores are of the suppurating
kind, a thick lymphatic-looking,
or inorganised substance being thrown
out, instead of organic particles, or granulations.
This, in the former disease,<span class="pagenum" title="297"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a></span>
very soon becomes black, and putrefies;
but the slough so formed differs materially
from that caused by gangrene; for,
in this disease, unless in the very last
stages, there are no real gangrenous
sloughs. It is unnecessary here to make
any particular observations on these diseases.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Herpes<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> is a disease which is very
frequent, and often prevents large ulcers
from healing, as these come to assume
the action of herpetic ulcers, although,
from their magnitude and depth, they
do not put on the same appearance as
when the disease is confined to the skin.
The large ulcers are of a dark sloughy ap<span class="pagenum" title="298"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a></span>pearance,
discharge thin matter, are painful,
and are surrounded with herpetic ulcers,
and scabs in the skin. This is a very
frequent disease on the legs, and is very
tedious. Bathing with warm sulphureous
water is often of service, at the same
time that we dress the parts in the intervals
with camphorated ointment. Citrine
ointment is also very useful; but the
following liquor is one of the best, and
most effectual applications:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
R.&ensp;Pulv. Calcis Vivi Recen. unciam.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Flor. Sulph. semiunciam.<br />
&emsp;&ensp;Aq. Font. sesquilibram. Coque ad dimidiam dein cola.
</p>

<p>This ought to be applied with cloths to
the parts.</p>

<p>When, by these means, the disease of
the skin, and the specific action of the<span class="pagenum" title="299"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a></span>
ulcer is removed, pressure is often of
service in completing the cure.</p>

<p>There is a specific ulcer, which is
met with most frequently on the legs,
and which is very troublesome. The skin
becomes in several points inflamed, or of
a dark red colour. These parts speedily
ulcerate, and the sores belong to the suppurating
kind, for no distinct granulations,
or organic particles, are formed;
but the surface is smooth and glossy, and
the discharge thin and copious. These
sores are generally pretty deep, in proportion
to their extent, or of a cup-like
appearance. They not unfrequently occur
in scrophulous habits. Mercury, exhibited
in small doses internally, appears
to be useful. Precipitate, as a local application,
generally answers very well;
but, when the sores become irritable, or<span class="pagenum" title="300"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a></span>
spread under this treatment, hemlock
poultices succeed better.</p>

<p>There is a small ulcer, which sometimes
is met with on the foot, of an irregular
shape, fiery appearance, and surrounded
with thick jagged margins,
which, in particular parts, are white, and
callous. The neighbouring integuments
are of a dark red colour. The discharge
is thin, and the pain considerable. Caustic,
and afterwards the application of the
adhesive plaster, are the best local applications.
Internally, the use of hemlock
is sometimes of service.</p>

<p>It occasionally happens, that, nearly
about the same time, most of the patients
in a ward of an hospital shall have their
ulcers rendered unhealthy. They become
foul, dark coloured, and spread:
The discharge is thin, and the pain is<span class="pagenum" title="301"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a></span>
greater than formerly. The application
of cloths dipped in gastric juice is sometimes
of service in these sores, and is one
of the best remedies; but, not unfrequently,
the patient must be removed to
a different situation before a cure can be
obtained.</p>

<p>Having made these detached remarks
on some specific ulcers, I shall, in the
succeeding dissertations, consider, at greater
length, others, which are, in the general
estimation, considered as more dangerous
and alarming.</p>

<h2>DISSERTATION IV.</h2>
</div>

<h3><i>On the Spongoid Inflammation.</i></h3>


<p>The disease which I am now going to
consider, has either not been described
at all by any author, or has, when it was
noticed, been considered as of a cancerous
nature. It is perhaps one of the
most alarming diseases to which we are
subjected; because, as yet, we know of
no specific remedy; and an operation
can only be useful at a time when it is
very difficult to persuade the patient to
submit to it.</p>

<p>I have named it the spongoid inflammation,
from that spongy elastic<span class="pagenum" title="303"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a></span>
feel which peculiarly characterises the
disease, and which continues even after
ulceration takes place.</p>

<p>This disease begins with a small colourless
tumor, which, if there be no
thick covering over it, such as the fascia
of a muscle, or the aponeurosis of the
foot, is soft and elastic, but tense if otherwise.
It is at first free from uneasiness;
but, by degrees, a sharp acute pain darts
occasionally through it, more and more
frequently, until the sensation becomes
continued. For a considerable time, the
tumor is smooth and even, but afterwards
it projects irregularly in one or
more points; and the skin at this place
becomes of a livid red colour, and feels
thinner. It here readily yields to pressure,
but instantly bounds up again. Small openings
now form in these projections, through
which is discharged a thin bloody matter.<span class="pagenum" title="304"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a></span>
Almost immediately after these tumors
burst, a small fungus protrudes, like a
papilla, and this rapidly increases, both
in breadth and heighth, and has exactly
the appearance of a carcinomatous fungus,
and frequently bleeds profusely.
The matter is thin, and exceedingly fœtid,
and the pain becomes of the smarting
kind. The integuments, for a little
around these ulcers, are red, and tender.
After ulceration takes place, the neighbouring
glands swell, and assume exactly
the spongy qualities of the primary tumor.
If the patient still survive the
disease in its present advanced progress,
similar tumors form in other parts of
the body, and the patient dies hectic.</p>

<p>On examining the affected parts after
death or amputation, the tumor itself is
found to consist of a soft substance, somewhat
like the brain, of a greyish colour,<span class="pagenum" title="305"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a></span>
and greasy appearance, with thin membranous-looking
divisions running thro’
it, and cells, or abscesses, in different
places, containing a thin bloody matter,
occasionally in very considerable quantity.
There does not seem uniformly to
be any entire cyst surrounding the tumor,
for it very frequently dives down betwixt
the muscles, or down to the bone,
to which it often appears to adhere.
The neighbouring muscles are of a pale
colour, and lose their fibrous appearance,
becoming more like liver than muscle.
The bones are uniformly caries, when in
the vicinity of these tumors. If large,
they are found rough, and broken off
into fragments; if small, they are generally
soft and porous. This tumor is
sometimes caused by external violence;
but often it appears without any evident
cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="306"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a></span></p>

<p>I know of no remedy which has a
power of checking the progress of the
complaint, or removing it. Friction,
with anodyne balsams, sometimes gives
relief in the early stages; but it does not
seem to retard the progress of the disease.
Extirpation is the only remedy
which has a prospect of being successful;
but it is only adviseable in the early
stages, whilst the disease is entirely local,
and has not extended to the neighbouring
glands; for, after they become affected,
the chance of recovery is greatly
diminished. It is, however, sometimes
difficult to persuade patients at this time
to submit to amputation, or extirpation,
because the pain and inconveniences are
inconsiderable; but the operation ought
to be urged with all the eagerness which
a conviction of its absolute necessity, and
its precarious issue, if delayed, will inspire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="307"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a></span></p>

<p>After making these observations, I
shall illustrate the subject with the following
cases, the first of which is intended
to show the difficulty of extirpating
the disease, when the operation is delayed
after the first appearance of the
tumor. In the second, we see the destruction
which the bones suffer by it,
and the extent of parts which it may affect.
The third gives us an instance of
the affection of the glands: And the
fourth, of the most advanced stage, or
that in which distant parts have suffered.
The last is an instance of the good effects
of an early operation.</p>


<p class="tac mtb1em">CASE I.</p>

<p>William Stirling, without any
very evident cause, perceived a small tumor
on the top of the shoulder, about
midway betwixt the termination of the<span class="pagenum" title="308"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a></span>
neck and the articulation of the humerus.
This gradually increased for some months,
and by the time when I saw him was
larger than a goose’s egg: It was spongy
and elastic, and attended occasionally with
pain.</p>

<p>Although the duration of the tumor
was an unfavourable circumstance,
yet I undertook the operation. I made
an incision through the whole length of
the skin, and dissected it off the tumor, (the
upper part of which was covered with a
coat, or cyst), down to its base; but, when
I now began to separate it from the parts
below, I found that it had no defined
bottom, but penetrated down betwixt
the muscles, which were soft, pale, and
had lost their fibrous structure. I therefore
cut off the tumor close by the muscles,
and then separating them with the
back of the scalpel, I removed with the<span class="pagenum" title="309"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a></span>
finger as much of the tumor as I could
observe. Several arteries sprung; but
these were pretty readily tied, although
the vessels were very tender. A troublesome
oozing, however, took place from
many points of the diseased muscles.
This was moderated by applying the
sponge dipped in cold water, after which
the skin was laid down, and its lips
brought close together.</p>

<p>On dressing the patient on the third day
after the operation, the skin was found not
to have united; but its lips were red and
inflamed. In this state it continued for
several days, when the part began to
grow tumid, and discharge a thin fœtid
matter. The skin then retracted still
more, and a fungus protruded, which
gradually increased; but it was smooth
and regular, and of a pale colour, so that
it rather had the appearance of a superficial<span class="pagenum" title="310"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a></span>
ulcer, raised up by a tumor from
below, than the ulcerated surface of a
diseased substance itself. In this state it
continued for two or three months, when
irregular projections appeared on the ulcerated
surface of the new tumor. These
soon burst, and a fungus protruded, of
a carcinomatous appearance, and bleeding
very frequently and profusely. Swellings
of the axillary glands succeeded
this, and the patient became much enfeebled,
and evidently hectic. As I have
not heard of him for several weeks, I suppose
that he has died.</p>

<p>In this case a second tumor succeeded
to the first, owing to the impossibility of
extirpating the whole, and this exactly
resembled the original one, except in
having its surface covered from its commencement
with an ulcer; but this ulcer
was not the specific one of the spongoid
inflammation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="311"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a></span></p>


<p class="tac mtb1em">CASE II.</p>

<p>John Overend was attacked with
pain in the right thigh and loins, which
were considered as rheumatic. Shortly
after the thigh was observed to be elongated,
and issues were applied over the
hip joint, upon the supposition of its
being a common case of morbus coxarius.
But no considerable relief was obtained
by this; on the contrary, the upper part
of the thigh swelled, whilst the lower part
wasted, his appetite diminished, his pulse
was quickened, and he passed sleepless
nights. The thigh was rubbed with
anodyne balsam, and draughts with laudanum
were given every night, but only
with temporary benefit. For the course
of some months these complaints continued,
with occasional remission and aggravation.
At last he began to complain<span class="pagenum" title="312"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a></span>
of difficulty in making water; and this
soon ended in a complete retention. The
catheter was attempted to be passed; but
although its point was bent, and directed
so as to correspond to any deviation of
the prostate gland from its right situation,
it could not be introduced. By examining
per anum, a large elastic tumor
could be felt in the pelvis, which was considered
as the bladder. A trocar was therefore
passed up the rectum, and the bladder
attempted to be tapped. A considerable
quantity of bloody fluid came away;
but he complained of no pain at the
glans, which most patients do when the
bladder is wounded; and a considerable
quantity of high coloured fœtid urine
was voided by the urethra, and continued
even afterwards to be passed, although
with some difficulty. Within a
week after this the patient died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="313"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a></span></p>

<p>On dissection, I found the hip joint to
be completely surrounded with a soft matter,
resembling the brain, inclosed in thin
cells, and here and there cells full of thin
bloody water; the head of the femoral
bone was quite carious, as was also the
acetabulum. The muscles were quite
pale, and almost like boiled liver, having
lost completely their fibrous appearance,
and muscular properties. On opening
the abdominal cavity, the same kind of
substance was found within the pelvis;
and the greatest part of the inside of the
bones of the affected side were quite carious.
Large cells were found in this
diseased substance, containing bloody water;
and it was into one of these that
the trocar had entered when the bladder
was attempted to be tapped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="314"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a></span></p>


<p class="tac mtb1em">CASE III.</p>

<p>James Walker received a stroke
upon the outside of the foot, immediately
below the ankle joint. A small tumor
instantly formed, which continued stationary
for several weeks, and gave him
little uneasiness; but afterwards it began
to increase, and was attended with a
shooting pain. The tumor was elastic,
pretty tense, and rather irregular in its
appearance. I was anxious to operate,
but the man would not give his consent.
I therefore advised frictions with
anodyne balsam, which at first gave
him relief, but soon lost its effect. For
several weeks I heard nothing of him;
but, at the end of this time, he again applied
to me. The irregularities of the
tumor were much greater, more prominent,
of a red colour, and one of them<span class="pagenum" title="315"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a></span>
had burst: From this a soft half-organised
fungus protruded, and a bloody
fluid run out constantly. An operation
was again urged, but the timidity of the
patient made him again refuse. A month
after this he came under the management
of another surgeon. There were
now three openings in the tumor, from
each of which protruded a broad cauliflower-looking
fungus, covered with
thick fœtid matter; there was likewise
a thin red serum discharged from
the margins of the ulcers. The tumor
was as large as a child’s head, and one of
the inguinal glands was a little swelled.
The man now consented to lose his limb,
and amputation was accordingly performed.
Whenever the turniquet was
applied, a very copious stream of veinous
blood issued from the tumor; but this
ceased when the veins had emptied themselves.
Unluckily it was considered as<span class="pagenum" title="316"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a></span>
unnecessary to extirpate the diseased
gland.</p>

<p>On examining the leg, all the bones of
the ankle joint were found to be quite
soft and carious; the tumor consisted of
a soft substance, resembling the brain,
with light membranous intersections.
The cyst on the upper part was hard and
thick, but beneath it was entirely wanting,
having either never been formed betwixt
the tumor and the tendons of the
muscle, or having been destroyed. The
former opinion is the most probable; for
I have never in any stage found the cyst
continued over the under or back part
of the tumor, but it always terminated
imperfectly in the part on which the tumor
was seated.</p>

<p>The wound healed as well as could
be desired, but the gland became rather<span class="pagenum" title="317"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a></span>
larger, notwithstanding which no operation
was urged. Two months after this
I was requested to visit him. The gland
was now as large as the head of a newborn
child; it was soft and spongy, and
had at one part an irregular prominence,
but the skin was not coloured. The
pulse was about one hundred and thirty,
and the patient completely hectic. In
this situation I proposed nothing excepting
nourishment. He died in the course
of a week after I saw him.</p>


<p class="tac mtb1em">CASE IV.</p>

<p>The following case shows this disease
in its most advanced stage. It is extracted
from the fifth volume of the London
Medical Journal, and is intituled, “An
Account of the Fatal Effects produced
by attempting to remove a Ganglion<span class="pagenum" title="318"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a></span>
by Seton.” It was drawn up by Mr.
W. Dease, surgeon in Dublin.</p>

<p>“In July 1781, a clergyman, aged thirty-seven,
consulted me about a moveable
ganglion, of the size of a small nutmeg,
situated between the fore-finger and
thumb of his right hand, near the wrist.
He was eager to have it removed, and
had been advised, for this purpose, to
have a seton passed through it, as the
best and most certain method; but, as
he was apparently a robust healthy man,
and the ganglion was attended with no
pain, I advised him to consider it as a
matter of no consequence, and not to
meddle with it. Four months after this
I was desired to visit him, and found
him in a melancholy situation. A seton
had been passed through the ganglion,
and the consequences were, that the back
of his hand had inflamed violently, that<span class="pagenum" title="319"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a></span>
the ganglion had rapidly and amazingly
increased, and that the openings made
by the seton were filled with an ill-conditioned
fungus, which sprung up as
fast as it was removed, and was attended
with frequent hemorrhage, and much
pain. In consultation, it was agreed to
remove this fungus by a free incision,
which was done, and the metacarpal
bones appeared bare and rough. Another
opening was made through the thenar,
and a seton passed through it, in
order more effectually to prevent the
growth of fungus. The bark was administered
in large quantities, an opiate
was given at night, and due attention
was paid to the regimen of the patient.
This method seemed to promise the most
happy event. The fungus appeared to
be entirely destroyed, a laudable suppuration
took place, the swelling of the
hand subsided, and the sores in a short<span class="pagenum" title="320"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a></span>
time were so contracted as to indicate
their speedy cicatrization. These favourable
appearances, however, were not
of long continuance; for, after some
time, the fungus began gradually to rise
again, and any mode of keeping it down,
either by caustic, cutting, or pressure,
seemed to produce no permanent good
effect, as it increased rapidly, and at
length degenerated into the most frightful
cancerous fungus I have ever seen.
Every local application that has been recommended
in similar cases was tried in
this, but without success; and internal
remedies proved equally inefficacious.
He took, for a considerable length of
time, two ounces of bark in substance,
in the course of twenty-four hours, so
that he took, in the whole, twenty-eight
pounds of that medicine. The extract
of hemlock had also a fair trial, but produced
no apparent effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="321"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a></span></p>

<p>“When he had laboured under this
complaint fifteen months, he was advised
to undergo the amputation of his
hand; but before he would consent to
submit to this operation, he chose to
have an account of his case transmitted
to the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris,
that he might have their opinion of
it: The result of which was, that the
members of the academy pronounced the
fungus not cancerous, but merely scorbutic.
This decision, by the bye, should
make us extremely cautious in delivering
our sentiments on similar occasions,
without seeing the patient, as much depends
on the general appearance of the
sores in cases of this sort. The academy
were of opinion, that the disease was entirely
local, and required only local treatment.
For this purpose, they advised
that the fungus should be taken down
by means of euphorbium, savine, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum" title="322"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a></span>
and afterwards washed with salt water.
If this method proved ineffectual, recourse
was to be had to the actual cautery,
from the application of which they
seemed to expect the most decisive advantages.
To this mode of treatment
the unhappy sufferer submitted; and,
during the space of six weeks, the fungus
was almost every day burnt down
with the actual cautery; but his complaint
all the while continued to gain
ground apace; so that being now disappointed
in all his expectations of relief
from regular practitioners, he had recourse
to quacks of every denomination.
The arsenic plaster of Plunket was applied,
and he was salivated for seven
weeks. At length, after undergoing the
operation of a variety of nostrums, he
again placed himself under my care. In
consultation, it was much doubted whether
amputation should now be thought<span class="pagenum" title="323"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a></span>
of, as the patient seemed to be in the
last stage of a cancerous consumption.
His limbs were swelled, and his whole
habit was wasted by the repeated hemorrhage
from the fungus, which was now
so increased in bulk as to weigh down
his arm, and entirely cover the back of
his hand. In short, after every return of
hemorrhage, it was apprehended that the
next would put a period to his sufferings.</p>

<p>“The hazard of the operation, and the
little chance he had of its proving successful,
being explained to him, the unfortunate
man earnestly begged to be
relieved from so hideous a load, even
though he should die under the operation.
I therefore yielded to his entreaties,
and took off the hand a little above
the wrist, in November 1782, although
there was a small indurated gland above<span class="pagenum" title="324"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a></span>
the elbow. On dissecting the hand immediately
after I had taken it off, the
fungus, on being cut, appeared to be extremely
similar to the substance of the
brain, and to arise from the metacarpal
bones of the middle and fore-finger.
These bones were in part dissolved, and
the other bones of the hand were also
in a morbid state.</p>

<p>“No accident occurred during the amputation;
but soon after it, a colliquative
diarrhœa came on, which seemed to be
increased by opiates and astringents, but
was at length checked with draughts of
fixed alkaline salt and lemon juice, swallowed
in the act of effervescence. He
afterwards took the bark, drank seltzer
water, and was allowed a liberal use of
wine. The suppuration for some time
was ichorous and bad, but he gained
strength daily. At the end of seven<span class="pagenum" title="325"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a></span>
weeks, the stump was completely cicatrized,
and the indurated gland above
the elbow had disappeared. He went
into the country, drank goat’s whey,
bathed in the sea, became very corpulent,
and seemed to be in perfect health,
but had somewhat of a sallow bloated
appearance. He continued well till July
1783, when he began to complain of
pains in his back, attended with rigidity.
These pains, as they increased, extended
down his thighs and legs, and occasioned
him to sleep ill at night. He grew feverish,
his pulse beat extremely quick,
and his countenance acquired a shining
yellowish red colour, an appearance
which I have remarked to be characteristic
of a cancerous habit. He now
began to walk with difficulty. I took a
small quantity of blood from him, and
found the texture of the crassamentum
extremely loose, and the serum in too<span class="pagenum" title="326"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a></span>
great quantity. He was very difficult to
purge, and unfortunately was under a
constant necessity of taking medicines to
procure the necessary discharges. Antimonials
in a variety of forms were given,
and the bark was again tried, as were
all the medicines that are usually prescribed
in rheumatic cases. Blisters were
applied, and issues cut in his thighs, but
all to no purpose. He was obliged to
take to his bed in August, and never after
quitted it.</p>

<p>“It is difficult to form an idea of the
constant and excruciating pain this poor
man suffered. Opium, though given in
large doses, afforded him but little relief,
and at last none at all. He generally
lay on his back, fixed as it were to
the bed, the least motion occasioning the
most intense pain. As the disease advanced,
he complained of a difficulty of<span class="pagenum" title="327"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a></span>
passing his urine, which was loaded with
a viscid mucus, and he once discharged
an oblong calculus; but at last he voided
his urine involuntarily, and sometimes
even his fœces, but the latter only rarely,
when he had taken a purgative, which,
as I have already mentioned, was required
to be of the most active kind,
otherwise it produced no effect.</p>

<p>“During the whole course of the
disease, his pulse was rapid, but his
tongue was remarkably soft and florid.
He was never delirious. Latterly, he
spit blood once or twice; his lower extremities
became very œdematous, and
his back was covered with eschars; but
these dropped off, and the sores suppurated
and healed kindly. Two months
before his death, his pains abated considerably.
He died without pain, March 4
1784, which was about two years and<span class="pagenum" title="328"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a></span>
nine months from the time the seton
was passed, and a year and four months
from the time he underwent the amputation.</p>

<p>“His body was opened a few hours
after his death. The abdominal viscera
appeared to be perfectly sound, and of
their natural colour, except the liver,
which had a small steatoma on its convex
surface, but was in other respects
healthy. The gall bladder was rather
fuller of yellow bile than it is generally
found to be. The left kidney was enlarged,
and on dividing it longitudinally,
much red gravel was found in its pelvis,
and the ureter seemed much lessened.
The urinary bladder was contracted, and
its coats uncommonly thickened, but no
sabulous concretions were observed in
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="329"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a></span></p>

<p>“On each side of the vertebræ lumborum,
the lumbar regions were rendered
convex by a large cancerous deposition,
which elevated the psoæ muscles;
and when the cellular investitures, which
were condensed into a cyst, were opened,
the cancerous matter appeared in a large
quantity, in colour and consistence exactly
resembling the fungus of the hand,
and not unlike the substance of the brain.
The whole weighed about five pounds;
and when this was removed, the last vertebra
of the back, and the three first of
the loins, were found to be in a softened,
eroded, and in some parts a totally dissolved
state. There appeared not the
least mark of ichor, sanies, inflammation,
or hardness of the soft parts; nor were
the mesenteric glands at all affected.
The matter seemed to have been really
a cancerous exudation, and to be formed
chiefly of coagulable lymph. This cancerous<span class="pagenum" title="330"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a></span>
mass seemed to possess a remarkable
dissolving power, which was exerted
wholly on the bones, and did not, as
usual in cases of this sort, cause any schirrous
hardness of the surrounding soft
parts.”</p>


<p class="tac mtb1em">CASE V.</p>

<p>A woman, some time after receiving
a blow on the leg, perceived a small
moveable tumor. It was soft, elastic, and
seated on the outside of the leg, about
half way betwixt the knee and ankle
joint. I made a small incision through
the skin down to the tumor, and dissected
it off to its base. I then dissected the
substance off from the facia of the muscle,
and brought the skin together with adhesive
plaster. It united readily, and the
patient was cured. The tumor was soft,
like brain, of a greyish colour, and greasy
consistence.</p>

<h2>DISSERTATION V.</h2>
</div>

<h3><i>On the Scrophulous Inflammation.</i></h3>


<p>Scrophula is a morbid condition,
which has been called the opprobrium
of surgery, much more justly perhaps
than any other disease, cancer itself not
excepted, for even this most dreadful
disorder may be removed by an early
operation; but the nature of scrophula
admits of no treatment equally successful.</p>

<p>From the obscurity in which its causes
are involved, and from no certain method
of cure being known, I can only<span class="pagenum" title="332"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a></span>
make a few unconnected remarks on this
disease.</p>

<p>A scrophulous system is generally
marked by a fine skin, delicate complexion,
light blue eyes, with opake sclerotica,
and frequently a swelling of the
upper lip. At other times, especially in
those who belong to what has been called
the melancholic temperament, the complexion
is darker, and the skin coarser;
but in these, at least when young, the
face is generally tumid, and the look unhealthy.</p>

<p>In these systems, as will presently be
observed, almost every disease is different,
in some points, from the same disease
when it occurs in a healthy person; but
the action which more decidedly manifests
this modification, is the inflammatory,
insomuch, that, by some, scrophula<span class="pagenum" title="333"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a></span>
and scrophulous inflammation have
been confounded; and this disease has
been described only in so far as it has
appeared conjoined with inflammation.
We have therefore almost always in the
description of scrophula a swelling of the
glands, and subsequent ulceration, or inflammatory
affections of other parts of
the body, detailed as necessary and essential
symptoms.</p>

<p>The scrophulous inflammation is marked
by a soft swelling of the affected part,
which very frequently is one of the lymphatic
glands. The covering, or coat of
the gland, becomes slightly thickened,
and its substance more porous and
<span class="nowrap">doughy<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span>. The swelling increases, and<span class="pagenum" title="334"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a></span>
the doughy feel changes by degrees into
that of elasticity, or fluctuation, and a
firm stool, or circumscribed hardened
margin, can be felt round the base of the
tumor. The skin is slightly red. If, at
this time, an incision or puncture be
made, either no matter, or very little, is
evacuated, the lips of the wound inflame
and open, displaying a sloughy-looking
substance within, and betwixt this and
the skin a probe can often be introduced
for some way all round. If, however,
the disease have been farther advanced,
then there is very little elasticity in the
tumor, it is quite soft, rather flaccid, and
fluctuates freely; the skin becomes of
a light purple colour, and small veins
may be seen ramifying on its surface.
In some time after these appearances are
observed, the skin may be felt becoming
thinner at one particular part, and here
it also generally becomes of a darker co<span class="pagenum" title="335"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a></span>lour,
then it bursts, and discharges a thin
fluid like whey, mixed with a curdy matter,
or thick white flocculi. The redness
of the skin still continues, but the aperture
enlarges in proportion as the tumor
subsides, forming the scrophulous ulcer.
The margins are smooth, obtuse, and
overlap the ulcer; they are of a purple
colour, and rather hard and tumid. The
surface of the sore is of a light red colour;
the granulations are flabby and
indistinct; and the aspect is of a peculiar
kind, which cannot be described.
The discharge is thin, slightly ropy, and
copious, with curdy-looking flakes. The
pain is inconsiderable.</p>

<p>When this ulcer has continued for
some time, it either begins slowly to cicatrize,
or more frequently the discharge
diminishes, and becomes thicker; it then
hardens into an elevated scab, of a dirty<span class="pagenum" title="336"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a></span>
white, or yellowish colour. This continues
for a considerable time, and then
crumbles off, leaving the part covered
with a smooth purple cicatrix. This description
corresponds to the mild scrophula,
or the struma mansueta of the
older writers; but occasionally, especially
if a bone be diseased below the ulcer,
the sore has a more fiery appearance, the
surface is dark coloured, the margins
soft, elevated, and inflamed, and sometimes
retorted. The discharge is watery,
the pain very considerable, and the surrounding
skin inflamed. This has been
called the struma maligna, and was said
to be marked by the greater degree of
hardness and inequality in the tumor,
varicose veins, and pulsatory pain: It
was likewise said to be contagious. But
although occasionally this state of the
scrophulous ulcer be preceded by a hard
and painful tumor, yet it is not necessarily<span class="pagenum" title="337"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a></span>
so, but rather seems to depend upon
a disease of the parts below, which generally
are bones, cartilages, or tendons in
a morbid state; and hence this overacting
scrophulous sore is most frequent
over the smaller joints, particularly the
toes.</p>

<p>Sometimes the scrophulous abscess,
after bursting, forms a sinus, the mouth
of which ulcerates, and assumes the appearance
of the specific ulcer; but the
track of the sinus remains in a suppurating
state. This not unfrequently is connected
with a diseased bone, or cartilage,
or tendon.</p>

<p>Scrophulous tumors and ulcers more
readily disappear during the winter, and
return again on the approach of summer;
but this is by no means an universal law
of the disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="338"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a></span></p>

<p>It is likewise observable, that swellings
of the glands are very apt to subside pretty
rapidly in one place, and appear equally
quickly in some other glands, in the
vicinity of these originally affected. Ulcers
likewise frequently heal upon the
appearance of the disease in other parts.</p>

<p>When the joints become affected, the
cartilages swell, and the quantity of the
lubricating matter is increased; the tendons
are surrounded with a glairy matter,
like the white of egg; and, lastly, the
bone becomes enlarged. These effects
are attended with stiffness and pain in
the joint, which is sometimes intolerable,
especially during the night, and confined
to a single spot, from the disease residing
chiefly there. In some time after this,
small abscesses form in different parts of
the inflamed joint, which gives it a spongy
elastic feel. These bursting into one ano<span class="pagenum" title="339"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a></span>ther,
form a larger cavity, which communicates
with the articulating surface of
the bones, and reaches to the skin, through
which a fluctuation may be felt. This abscess
at last bursts, and discharges a curdy
matter. Long before this happens, the
bone generally ulcerates, and becomes
rough. This disease is uniformly attended
with hectic, which terminates the
patient’s misery.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently, in scrophulous
people, eruptions appear on different
parts of the body, especially on the face,
which is covered with pustules of a dark
red colour, suppurating slowly, and sometimes
never.</p>

<p>At other times, we find incysted tumors
on different parts of the body.
These may appear in any habit; but
when they occur in scrophulous people,<span class="pagenum" title="340"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a></span>
they assume the specific action of the
constitution; in which case, instead of
containing an uniform fluid, like thin
jelly, of a yellowish colour, as the simple
incysted tumor does, they are filled with
a thick curdy purulent-looking matter,
or with serum, containing white flakes,
little lumps, of a white substance.</p>

<p>All the causes capable of inducing
simple inflammation will of consequence
induce the scrophulous inflammation,
provided that the inflammation be not
induced in such a way, and in such organs
as make it heal rapidly, as will be
afterwards noticed. Specific inflammation
is likewise modified when it takes
place in a scrophulous constitution, and
is much more tedious in its cure. This
is evidently seen in the small pox and venereal
disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="341"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a></span></p>

<p>Although the effects of a scrophulous
constitution, in modifying action, be
most distinctly observed in the inflammatory
action, yet it does not operate
exclusively on this; on the contrary, we
find, that typhus fever, and some other
actions, which may exist without any
perfect local inflammation, are, cæteris
paribus, more violent in scrophulous habits
than in others.</p>

<p>This constitution is more easily acted
on by certain agents, particularly such as
tend to induce inflammation, than healthy
constitutions in the same circumstances.
It would likewise appear, that, on the contrary,
there are other agents which operate
with more difficulty. It is in general
observable, that scrophulous people are
less easily affected with mercury. On a
few, indeed, it operates readily; but,
when we attend to the general habitude<span class="pagenum" title="342"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a></span>
of these people, we must consider the aptitude
of some individuals to assume the
mercurial action to depend on some peculiarity
of constitution, unconnected with
the scrophulous condition.</p>

<p>By the ancients, and many of the
moderns, the pituita was considered as
the cause of scrophula, producing tumefaction,
by stagnating in the glands.
When any of the bile became mixed
with the pituita, then the inflammation
was more violent, and the ulceration
deeper. Some latter writers, convinced
that a simple redundancy of any particular
humour could not produce scrophula,
had recourse to the supposition of an acrimony,
which was productive of swelling
and ulceration, and which might “taint
the whole fluids of the <span class="nowrap">body<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="343"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a></span></p>
<p>Others attempted to explain this disease,
upon the principle of debility existing
in the whole body, but particularly
in the lymphatic <span class="nowrap">system<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span>. This is an
idea still more puerile than the doctrine
of morbid humours, which, however unfounded,
had several plausible arguments
to support it, and which was incontrovertible
until the laws of the animal economy
were better understood. Simple
debility never can give rise to the marks
of the scrophulous constitution; it cannot
produce ulcers of a nature and appearance
so peculiar; neither can it explain
why particular parts are more apt
to be affected than others; because, if
debility exist equally in every part of the
absorbent system, then every part ought
to be alike diseased; and if it exist only
in particular parts, then it is necessary to<span class="pagenum" title="344"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a></span>
point out some cause of this partial debility.
We likewise frequently observe
very great debility in this system, owing
to general weakness, and yet no symptoms
of scrophula appear in consequence.</p>

<p>Scrophulous people possess a peculiar
constitution, and may therefore be
said to constitute, in one respect, a distinct
variety of the human race. This
state is produced by a peculiar condition
of the semen (owing to the peculiarity of
the system which forms it), or of the female
organs of generation, which possess
the same general nature with the body,
of which they form a part. When the
organs of generation in both sexes are
healthy, that is to say, similar in nature
to what may be considered as the proper
nature of the human race, taken as a distinct
class of animals, then the semen
stimulates the ovarium to the formation<span class="pagenum" title="345"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a></span>
of a healthy child, or one which possesses
a constitution, or susceptibility of performing,
and having actions induced in
it, similar to that of the majority of
mankind. In this process, the ovarium
is to be considered as a gland, and the
semen as its peculiar stimulus. If, however,
either the nature of the gland, or
of its stimulus be changed, it is evident
that the action induced must be more or
less modified, and the secretion or product
changed to a greater or less degree
in its nature and properties. Were it
possible for a progeny to be produced by
an intercourse betwixt the human and
the brute creation, they would possess a
nature different from both, or perform
actions of a mixed kind. This may be
observed with regard to mules amongst
brutes. In the same way, a healthy and
scrophulous person must produce a child<span class="pagenum" title="346"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a></span>
which differs from a healthy one, in having
a certain peculiarity of constitution.</p>

<p>Agents produce different effects in
different animals; thus the matter of
cow-pox applied to the cow and to man
produce very different appearances. Agents
likewise, in the same genus of animals,
produce different effects, according
to the peculiar constitution of the individual.
Thus, the matter of small-pox
in some men produces only a slight local
sore, whilst in the generality it produces
a general disease, and eruption. The
same disease affords an instance of changes
taking place in the constitution after
birth, by the establishment of certain actions;
for it is rendered unsusceptible of
the same action being induced afterwards;
and, in this respect, is brought
to resemble the constitution of a different
genus of animals, with regard to that<span class="pagenum" title="347"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a></span>
disease. There are some constitutions,
such as those called irritable, in which
certain symptoms of febrile, and other
actions, are much more violent than in
people of a different description. In them,
for instance, typhus fever is attended with
a very frequent pulse, and yet the other
effects of this action are not violent in
the same proportion.</p>

<p>Peculiarity of constitution is often
manifested by no evident sign, and the
modifications of actions induced are often
marked by no perceptible diseased
phenomena, which may be considered as
belonging exclusively to that constitution.
But, in the scrophulous constitution,
there are, in almost every instance,
perceptible modifications of the formative
<span class="nowrap">action<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span>, producing a peculiar appearance<span class="pagenum" title="348"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a></span>
of the eye, countenance, &amp;c. as has
already been mentioned; and although
some diseased actions, which receive modifications
from this peculiarity of constitution,
may not be attended with obvious
alterations, yet others, especially such
as are attended with an inflammatory
condition, are distinctly changed. It is
these changes which constitute what in
common language has been called scro<span class="pagenum" title="349"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a></span>phula,
which is merely a peculiarity of a
common action (namely, inflammation),
which is dependent, not upon any particular
nature of the agent or exciting
cause, but upon the peculiarity of constitution,
which is susceptible, by these
agents, of such an action.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will appear,
that I consider the scrophulous inflammation,
or what has in common language
been called scrophula, merely as
an accidental circumstance, occurring in
a scrophulous constitution; but it is by
much the most dangerous and troublesome
effect of the peculiarity of constitution.
It has likewise a very evident effect
in increasing this condition of the
system; for we find, that the probability
of scrophula appearing in a child is, cæteris
paribus, correspondent to the presence
or absence of scrophulous inflammation<span class="pagenum" title="350"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a></span>
in the parent; or, in other words,
that those who have either at the time
of marriage, or before it, had scrophulous
inflammation, are more likely to
have their children strongly scrophulous,
than others of the same family, who have
not had inflammation. It is likewise
certain, that if, by any cure, we can, for
one or two generations, prevent the appearance
of scrophulous inflammation,
the children will become less and less
diseased, or have less peculiarity of constitution;
but if, by any accident, scrophulous
inflammation be in one of the
descendents excited, even in a slight degree,
his immediate progeny will be
more diseased than he himself before the
induction of the <span class="nowrap">inflammation<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="351"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a></span></p>
<p>With regard to the exciting causes of
scrophulous inflammation, I may remark,
that they are similar in kind to those capable
of inducing simple inflammation;
but they frequently operate more powerfully;
that is to say, causes which would
scarcely induce inflammation in a healthy
person, may induce a local disease,
and inflammation, in a scrophulous habit;
because the different parts of the
body perform their functions less healthily
in a strongly scrophulous person,
and are more easily deranged. In every
system, those parts which are most delicate,
or require the greatest perfection of
action in order to keep them right, are
most easily deranged. Now, in scrophulous
people, the natural action being modified,
the body becomes more delicate, and
is more susceptible of derangement, especially
those parts which naturally are <span class="pagenum" title="352"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a></span><span class="nowrap">delicate<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span>,
or require a perfection of action.
The glands seem to be amongst the most
delicate organs; for they have not only
to perform the formative, or nutritive
function, in common with every other
part, but they have also to perform a separate
and distinct function, or change
the nature of certain fluids which are
brought to them. It is on account of
the natural delicacy of the glandular system
being increased by the diseased condition
of the general system, and of the
exposure of the lymphatic glands to the
action of stimulating matter, taken up
by the absorbents on the surface, as, for
instance, matter from scabs on the head
of children, that this species of inflammation
most commonly appears in the<span class="pagenum" title="353"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a></span>
lymphatic system; but this system does
not seem to be the peculiar seat of the
diseased condition, as some suppose, nor
to be otherwise predisposed to scrophulous
inflammation, except in so far as its
natural delicacy is increased by the diseased
condition which it possessed, ab initio,
in common with the rest of the body;
and consequently it is rendered less
able to perform its functions properly,
the effect of which is, the induction of a
new local diseased action, or slow inflammatory
action, by the slightest cause.</p>

<p>Besides the common exciting causes
of inflammation, the particular formation
of organs may induce this disease, or at
least make very slight causes produce it.
Thus, for instance, in people with a very
small narrow chest, the circulation of the
blood must be performed with greater
action than in other circumstances, and<span class="pagenum" title="354"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a></span>
thus may tend to induce an inflammatory
state. When the bones are very
vascular, and imperfectly formed, they
are apt to have a morbid degree of
action excited in them by very slight
causes; and the same holds true with
regard to any other part of the body
which is imperfectly formed, or which
is not exactly fitted for the support and
performance of its requisite <span class="nowrap">action<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="355"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a></span></p>
<p>Scrophulous inflammation is in general
dangerous and tedious, in a degree
proportioned to the effects and duration of
simple inflammation upon the same parts.
Thus, simple inflammation of one of the
conglobate glands of the neck, is tedious,
but not dangerous; and the same holds
true of scrophulous inflammation; but
the duration of this is much longer.
Simple inflammation of the lungs, again,
is dangerous; and scrophulous inflammation
is infinitely more so. Such parts
as heal easiest, when affected with simple
inflammation, or ulceration, recover
soonest from scrophulous inflammation;
and the same causes which retard the
one will retard the other also. Thus,
the same cause which renders a superficial
simple ulcer unhealthy and chronic,
will prevent a superficial scrophulous ulcer
from healing: But, if none of these
causes operate, then scrophulous inflam<span class="pagenum" title="356"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a></span>mation,
or ulceration, will heal pretty
readily, provided that simple inflammation,
or ulceration of the same parts,
would do so; but, for this purpose, it
must be quickly induced; for all inflammation,
or ulceration, which is slowly
induced, is slowly removed. As a confirmation
of these positions, we find, that
a blister on a scrophulous person will
heal readily, because the inflammation
is induced acutely, or with a certain
degree of quickness, and has, when the
affection is simple, a promptitude to heal,
which manifests itself also in scrophulous
people. In this instance, the difference
in the time required to heal the inflammation
in a sound and a scrophulous
person is not perceptible; because the affection,
if simple, has a tendency to heal
immediately. But, in a deep wound,
especially if contused, we find the difference
more marked; because here, although<span class="pagenum" title="357"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a></span>
the constitution be healthy, the
duration of the disease is considerable;
and, in a scrophulous person, the cure is
protracted still longer, and the sore assumes
a specific appearance. In diseases
of the glands, the difference is still more
perceptible; because the disease, although
simple, is longer in duration. In affections
of the bones and cartilages, the
same is observed. When a bone is fractured
in a healthy person, it unites without
inflaming; and, in a scrophulous
person, unless the diathesis be exceedingly
strong, it likewise does so, but the
union is longer of taking place; but, if
a bone inflames in a sound person, the
disease is very tedious; and, in a scrophulous
habit, it is infinitely more so.
The same holds true with regard to tendons
and cartilages; and hence the greater
danger of a sprain in a scrophulous
than a healthy person. From these, and<span class="pagenum" title="358"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a></span>
other facts, which it is altogether unnecessary
to mention, it fully appears,
that scrophulous inflammation is tedious
and dangerous, in proportion to the progress
and effects of simple inflammation
and its consequences, when it attacks the
same parts; but this proportion is not
regular and uniform; but the duration
increases, in a higher ratio, in proportion
as the simple inflammation and ulceration
of the same parts, and in the same
circumstances, is tedious. Thus, a deep
wound in a healthy person is pretty long
of healing; but, in a scrophulous person,
it is much more so. Simple inflammation
of a gland is still more tedious than
the same extent of inflammation in cellular
substance; and scrophulous inflammation
is still longer of running its progress;
but the proportion betwixt the
duration of the scrophulous inflammation,
in these two cases, is not exactly as<span class="pagenum" title="359"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a></span>
the duration of the simple inflammation
of the two, compared with each other,
but is in an increased ratio.</p>

<p>When scrophulous inflammation is
excited in the vicinity of a part already
possessing this action, it occasionally removes
the action from that part, in the
same way as inducing simple inflammation
by a blister in one part cures the
same disease in another part in the vicinity.
It was an observation of this fact
which made it be considered as part of
the description of scrophulous tumors
and ulcers, that they not unfrequently
disappear in one place, whilst they show
themselves in another; but, in every
instance, this disappearance is an effect,
and not a cause; for we uniformly
observe, that, before it takes place, the
new part has begun to inflame or
swell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="360"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the diagnosis of scrophula,
it is impossible to say any thing
satisfactory; because, as long as the inflammation
remains trifling, and the skin
sound, it is very difficult, if not impossible,
to distinguish a scrophulous swelling
from any other of a different kind.
Much assistance has been supposed to be
derived from the situation of the tumors,
most of those which appear in the neck
being considered as scrophulous; but
this is certainly a false principle. From
the same method of reasoning, most swellings
in the groin have been considered
as venereal, whilst many are of a very
different nature, and not a few scrophulous.
The best plan is to attend to the appearance
of the body in general, and to
the presence or absence of the sign of a
scrophulous system; next, whether any
ulceration be present, by the absorption
of matter, from which these swellings<span class="pagenum" title="361"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a></span>
may have been produced. If these be
present in a system not possessing the
marks of scrophula, the probability
of the tumor being scrophulous is less;
but, if the system be evidently scrophulous,
then we must consider, whether the
glands, originally swelled by the absorption
of matter, have assumed the slow
inflammation of a scrophulous nature, or
have assumed a different species of inflammation,
dependent upon the peculiarity
of the matter; for they can scarcely
be supposed to be simply inflamed. Scrophulous
swellings of the lymphatic glands
are generally soft and doughy, and frequently
give the feel of containing a fluid
long before suppuration has taken place.
They are at first free from pain, and, in
mild cases, even toward the end, the pain
is inconsiderable. When matter is formed,
the skin generally becomes purple, and
then gives way in a small spot. Swellings of<span class="pagenum" title="362"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a></span>
the secreting glands are to be distinguished
from schiro-cancer, by the hardness
being less, the pain very inconsiderable,
the presence of a scrophulous habit, and
by the feel of fluctuation much earlier
than takes place in cancer. Upon the
whole, the presumption of any affection
being scrophulous, is to be formed by
the presence of the marks of a scrophulous
diathesis, and the absence of such
symptoms and appearances, whether antecedent
or present, which characterise
inflammation of a different species, or
make us suppose it to have taken place,
whether this be simple or specific. Scrophulous
ulceration is distinguished by its
peculiar aspect, joined with the marks of
a scrophulous habit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="363"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a></span></p>


<h3><i>Of the Treatment of the Scrophulous Inflammation.</i></h3>

<p>If the foregoing reasoning be just, it
will appear, that, in scrophulous habits,
our great attention ought to be directed
to the prevention of the scrophulous inflammation,
which is to be done by avoiding,
as far as lies in our power, the
operation of any agent tending to excite
inflammation. It has been observed,
that, in scrophulous systems, very slight
causes were sufficient to produce disease;
because the parts on which they act possess
a peculiar constitution, and are less
capable of performing their natural and
healthy functions properly, and therefore
are sooner rendered diseased. Inflammation
may also be induced by the
structure of the part being such as to<span class="pagenum" title="364"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a></span>
prevent it from carrying on its functions
properly, and therefore the same effect
is produced as in the former case, where
the constitution, or mode of action, and
not the evident structure or mechanism
of the part, was affected.</p>

<p>The lungs are to be prevented from
assuming the scrophulous inflammation,
by avoiding, in the first place, all the
common exciting causes of pneumonia,
such as cold, damp, &amp;c. It is, in the
next place, to be prevented, by avoiding
such causes as tend to increase the circulation
in the chest, or affect the function
of respiration. Hence, violent exercise,
climbing ascents, intoxication, thick hazy
atmosphere, are to be guarded against.</p>

<p>The lymphatic glands are to be prevented
from inflaming, by avoiding exposure
to cold, and to the other common<span class="pagenum" title="365"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a></span>
causes of inflammation, but especially by
preventing the absorption of irritating
matter, such as matter from sores, and the
like. A neglect of this is perhaps one of
the most frequent causes of scrophulous
inflammation; for swellings of the glands
of the neck can very often be distinctly
traced to scald head, to ulcerations about
the ears, little sores in the mouth, caries
of the teeth, or to the absorption of particles
of food allowed to remain and
undergo fermentation in the mouth.
The greatest attention ought therefore to
be paid to cleanliness. The head ought,
in scrophulous children, to be washed
daily, and the sweat removed from behind
the ears; vermin ought to be diligently
removed; but mercurial, and
acrid preparations, frequently used with
that intention, ought to be avoided.</p>

<p>The mesenteric glands are to be prevented<span class="pagenum" title="366"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a></span>
from inflaming, by supporting the
action of the bowels, and preventing the
formation of irritating matter, which,
when absorbed, may swell these glands.
Nourishing digestible diet, conjoined with
rhubarb, and such remedies as act as
tonics, at the same time that they keep
the belly easy, are of use in this view;
for the whole process of digestion is thus
supported, and neither the feculent part
of the food, nor the mucus of the intestines,
become morbidly irritating.</p>

<p>The other parts of the body are to be
prevented from inflaming, by avoiding
the usual causes of inflammation, and
the action of whatever may injure the
healthy condition of the part, or impede
the natural action. Thus, the knee and
ankle joint occasionally become affected
with scrophulous inflammation after fa<span class="pagenum" title="367"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a></span>tigue,
which injures the healthy condition
of the parts.</p>

<p>Besides these precautions, which are
necessary in those of an evidently scrophulous
constitution, with regard to particular
parts, it is likewise useful to preserve
as vigorous and perfect a performance
of the natural actions of the system,
considered in the aggregate, as possible,
by which we lessen the risk of any one
part becoming diseased; for, whatever
impedes or diminishes the performance
of the natural and healthy action of a
part (and, in this case, the whole body is
to be considered as made up of parts),
renders that part more susceptible of disease,
or derangement of its actions. Cleanliness,
pure air, warm and sufficient
clothing, nourishing and digestible diet,
invigorating exercise, and a due proportion
of sleep, are therefore very powerful<span class="pagenum" title="368"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a></span>
preventatives of this species of inflammation,
insomuch, that Dionis remarks, that
seventy-five out of the hundred, who
came to be touched by the king, were
children of the poor peasants.</p>

<p>When scrophulous inflammation does
take place, then this invigorating plan is
had recourse to as a cure, whilst, in
truth, it is most useful as a prophylactic.
The invigorating plan, which consists in
the use of good diet, moderate exercise,
sea bathing, &amp;c. is indeed useful at this
period, both because it tends to make the
disease more easily overcome, and prevents
other parts from being injured;
but its utility is still greater as a prophylactic;
and it does not appear to have
any certain efficacy in promoting the resolution
of scrophulous tumors, because
these have naturally a strong disposition
to advance slowly to suppuration, and<span class="pagenum" title="369"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a></span>
therefore are not readily affected by such
means as tend simply to strengthen the
system, or support its actions, because
these do not change its peculiarity, or
morbid modification, which existed, ab
origine. But, when the tumors have
proceeded the length of ulceration, then
they have gone a step farther to a natural
termination; and, although the
means which strengthen the system cannot
remove the scrophulous diathesis of
the system, they may nevertheless accelerate
the cure of a chronic tedious ulcer,
which is slowly tending of itself to a termination.</p>

<p>The remedies called agentes similes
operate more directly on the scrophulous
mode of action than those means which
tend simply to strengthen the system,
and may be usefully conjoined with
them, because these agents tend to induce<span class="pagenum" title="370"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a></span>
an action different from the scrophulous
one, at the same time that it
possesses a certain coincidence with, or general
resemblance to the natural or healthy
action. Hence, the bark has been
frequently found to be useful in the cure
of scrophulous inflammation, but oftener
of ulceration than tumefaction of the
glands, for the reason mentioned above.
It does not appear, however, to possess,
by any means, that certain power of
curing scrophulous affections which is
attributed to it by Dr. Fothergill, and
several other authors; nor are we to
suppose that it shall infallibly cure scrophulous
inflammation, or ulceration of
parts, which, even when affected with
simple inflammation, are very difficult to
be cured. If we find it difficult to cure a
simple inflammation, or ulceration of a
tendon, cartilage, or bone, we must not
be disappointed if even a specific remedy<span class="pagenum" title="371"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a></span>
for scrophula (granting such a one ever
to be discovered) were to prove ineffectual
in procuring a speedy restoration to
health. The bark is likewise often ineffectual,
because it is improperly administered.
Given in small quantities, once
or twice a-day, as is frequently done, it
may prove a stomachic, and increase, like
other tonic bitters, the power of the stomach,
or the functions dependent on it;
but we never can thus obtain the benefits
of the specific action of the bark on
the system. For this purpose, it must be
given liberally, in as great doses, and as
frequently repeated as can be done without
producing continued sickness, or vomiting;
and this must be continued regularly,
late and early, not for days, but
perhaps for weeks, at the same time that
we prevent the action of such causes as
would counteract the effects of the bark,<span class="pagenum" title="372"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a></span>
such as poor diet, bad air, <span class="nowrap">confinement<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span>,
&amp;c. Administered in this way, the bark
may be rendered really useful, not only
in the cure of scrophulous ulceration, but
perhaps of many other diseases, whilst,
in the common way of prescribing it,
little or no benefit is derived from it.</p>

<p>The muriated barytes has been recommended
by Dr. <span class="nowrap">Crawford<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span>, and has
of late been tried in France by M. <span class="nowrap">Pinel<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span>
and others. It does not appear to have
any influence on tumid glands, or scrophulous
tumors; but occasionally it is
serviceable in scrophulous ulceration. It
is, however, a medicine on which very<span class="pagenum" title="373"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a></span>
little dependence can be placed, and
which fails in a great majority of <span class="nowrap">instances<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span>.</p>

<p>The muriat of lime has been proposed
by M. de Fourcroy; it is given more liberally
than the muriated barytes, but it
is not more efficacious.</p>

<p>Iron by itself, or mixed with the
fixed or volatile alkalis, has also been<span class="pagenum" title="374"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a></span>
frequently employed, but with very little
<span class="nowrap">benefit<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span>.</p>

<p>Burnt sponge, millipedes, vitriolated
tartar, and many other trifling remedies,
which were at one time in repute, are
now deservedly neglected.</p>

<p>Cicuta has been greatly recommended
by Dr. Fothergill and <span class="nowrap">others<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span>.
It has very little effect on scrophulous
tumors, or mild ulcers; but, when administered
freely, it is sometimes of service
in the irritable fiery ulcer, which
was by the older writers called struma
maligna.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="375"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a></span></p>
<p>Mercury is another remedy, which
at one time was much employed in this
disease; but few expect any benefit from
it now. Gentle, or what has been called
alterative courses, are, however, still recommended
by many, with a view to
satisfy the patient. Various preparations
have been used. Some exhibited the
corrosive sublimate, others the calomel,
whilst the acetite of mercury, mixed
with the powder of vipers and earthworm,
with the rust of iron, was much
employed on the <span class="nowrap">continent<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span>. Antimony
has frequently been conjoined with this,
but without much benefit.</p>

<p>Nitrous acid has, I believe, in some
cases, a considerable power over scrophulous
ulcers. From the trials which I<span class="pagenum" title="376"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a></span>
have made with it, I am inclined to attribute
some effect to it in promoting the
suppuration of scrophulous glands, or
tumors, and in disposing ulcers to heal.
Two or three drachms may be given daily,
and continued for a fortnight, provided
no bad effect be produced by it,
such as pulmonic affections, &amp;c. If,
within this time, no melioration appear,
we may give up this medicine.</p>

<p>The hepatised ammonia, in the dose
of eight or ten drops, three times a-day,
is sometimes useful in abating the pain,
and changing the fiery appearance of the
irritable ulcer, or struma maligna.</p>

<p>The breathing of oxygene has been
proposed as a cure for this species of inflammation;
but it will be extremely
difficult for the advocates of pneumatic<span class="pagenum" title="377"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a></span>
medicine to point out any authentic case
in which it was really of benefit.</p>

<p>Much has been written concerning
the local treatment of scrophulous tumors
and ulcers; but we are still very
much in the dark with respect to any efficacious
method. Formerly, the extirpation
of the gland, or tumor, was advised
by all; but, more lately, doubts
have been started concerning the propriety
of the practice; and, by most
practitioners, it is now deemed unnecessary,
if not dangerous.</p>

<p>In the writings of the ancients, as
well as many of the older writers on
surgery in our own country, particularly
in the works of Mr. Wiseman, this
practice is freely inculcated; and many
cases are detailed in which the tumor
was extirpated with success. Even in<span class="pagenum" title="378"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a></span>
the present day, no surgeon dreads the
consequence of removing scrophulous
joints, which, with regard to the present
question, are to be considered in the same
light with the glands.</p>

<p>It is supposed, that, by extirpating
superficial tumors, the disease may be
transferred to some of the more noble
parts, and produce a more fatal complaint.
But, if it be admitted that these
tumors do not appear as necessary parts
of scrophula, as the eruption of measles
does of the rubeolous fever, but only as
accidental circumstances, or fortuitous
inflammations, rendered tedious and specific
by the peculiarity of the constitution,
this supposition will appear to be
groundless. Even granting that scrophulous
tumors did appear without any local
exciting cause, and were, in every respect,
similar to the eruption of exanthematous<span class="pagenum" title="379"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a></span>
fevers, it will not thence follow,
that removing the local disease, after it
has appeared, will make another part become
diseased; unless it be said that scrophula
depends upon a particular morbid
humour, which, if denied an outlet in
one place, must accumulate in another,
which is a supposition I will not trouble
myself to refute.</p>

<p>The arguments, then, against the excision,
are not to be drawn from its danger,
but from the pain which it produces,
and from the number of glands
which must frequently be removed, and
which might perhaps be resolved without
coming to suppuration. It is likewise
at times dangerous to extirpate these
tumors, on account of their situation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when only one
gland is affected, when it is superficial,<span class="pagenum" title="380"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a></span>
and has continued so long, in spite of
our remedies, that there is little probability
of resolving it, then, by extirpation,
we procure a speedy cure, and avoid
a tedious disagreeable ulcer, and unseemly
cicatrix. The existence of the
scrophulous inflammation, and particularly
the ulceration, has a tendency to
increase the scrophulous diathesis, or peculiar
mode of action of the system. By
cutting this short, therefore, we prevent
that evil, and render the system less susceptible
of the scrophulous inflammation,
and the chance of communicating the
disease to the progeny less.</p>

<p>It may also be said, that the wound,
after the extirpation, might not heal readily;
but the testimony of many writers,
as well as what I have observed myself,
convince me that this is not the case;
for the readiness with which the skin<span class="pagenum" title="381"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a></span>
unites and heals, when not previously
diseased, produces a speedy cure; whereas,
had the diseased gland remained below,
and the specific inflammation been
propagated to the skin, the ulceration
must have been tedious.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, then, in determining
on the propriety of extirpation, we must
consider whether there be only one gland
affected, or an incipient disease in a chain
of glands; and, if only one, whether there
be a probability of this one suppurating;
and whether the advantage of an early removal
of the affected part will not be
counterbalanced by our losing the chance
of restoring the part, and of preserving its
functions and utility, as, for instance, in
scrophulous inflammation of the breasts,
testicle, joints, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Caustics have been proposed with<span class="pagenum" title="382"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a></span>
the same view as the incision; but
they are more tedious, produce extensive
ulceration, greater pain, and are much
less certain than the operation.</p>

<p>Issues are recommended as a general
remedy, to act as a drain to the constitution,
and to render the drying up of
the ulcer safe. In this point of view,
they appear to be altogether useless and
unnecessary; but, when employed as
part of the local treatment, they are
much more useful. The benefit arising
from the use of issues, in the cure of
scrophulous inflammation of the bones
and joints, is now so fully established, by
the practice of every surgeon, that it is
useless to insist upon it here. In these
cases, it is necessary to insert the issue,
which is generally made with caustic, as
directly over the affected part as possible;
and the size of this issue ought in general<span class="pagenum" title="383"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a></span>
to be correspondent to the extent of the
disease. There are two circumstances
which greatly tend to render this practice
efficacious, and which ought to be
fully attended to: First, that the disease
be allowed to gain as little ground as
possible before the insertion of the issue,
or that the issue be inserted as early after
the disease is observed as the patient will
permit. Second, that, during the continuance
of the issue, every circumstance
be avoided which may counteract its use,
such as much use of the joint, or other
species of irritation. In diseases of the
lower extremities, therefore, whatever exercise
produces pain must be carefully
avoided; and, for the same reason, in
diseases of the spine, proper contrivances
to relieve the diseased bone from pressure
are necessary to be conjoined with
the issue. It sometimes happens, that
matter has either formed before the insertion<span class="pagenum" title="384"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a></span>
of the peas, or some time afterward.
In this case, it either comes to be
discharged by an opening through the
ulcerated surface, or issue, or it bursts at
a more dependent part. In the first
situation, no change of treatment is necessary;
in the second, it is of service to
insert a pea over the mouth of the aperture,
which has a tendency to heal the
part below, and prevent the formation of
a tedious sinus. When the part becomes
free from pain, and the soft parts have
subsided in their swelling, and matter does
not appear to be forming, or does not
continue to be formed, if it had already
been secreted, we may consider that the
effect of the issue is now produced, and
may begin gradually to diminish its
size.</p>

<p>Issues, employed as a local remedy,
have hitherto been chiefly used in diseases<span class="pagenum" title="385"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a></span>
of the bones and joints, and sometimes
in scrophulous affections of the
liver, or lungs; but it is reasonable to
suppose that they ought likewise to be
useful in the cure of enlargements of the
glands, and other scrophulous tumors, if
inserted in the immediate vicinity of the
part. The only objection to their use
is the cicatrix which they leave, and
which, in certain situations, we would
wish to avoid. When the tumor is
thickly covered with the integuments,
the issue may be made directly over it,
by means of a blister, kept open by savine
<span class="nowrap">ointment<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span>, or any other irritating
preparation; but, when the tumor is<span class="pagenum" title="386"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a></span>
thinly covered, this will not succeed, as
the inflammation consequent to the insertion
of the issue will be communicated
to the gland which is in immediate contact
with the ulcerated surface. In this
case, a small pea issue, or seton, may be
inserted by the side of the tumor. In
scrophulous inflammation of the glands
of the neck, this remedy is not adviseable,
owing to the scar which it leaves; but,
in affections of the mammæ, and some
other parts, it may be useful.</p>

<p>Blisters, frequently repeated, are
sometimes, in slighter cases of affections
of the joints, used in place of issues.</p>

<p>Preparations of lead are frequently
employed, and, where the tumor is painful,
are often of service. When the lymphatic
glands are inflamed, a saturnine<span class="pagenum" title="387"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a></span>
<span class="nowrap">solution<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span>, applied cold to the part, by
means of a compress of linen, and frequently
renewed, has a tendency to abate
the pain and resolve the inflammation.
These solutions are sometimes employed
warm, particularly in affections of the
bones or joints; but they do not, in these
cases, seem to have any considerable superiority
over fomentations with warm
water.</p>

<p>Cloths dipped in cold water, sea water,
or weak vegetable acids, have also been
used, and have a tendency to abate pain,
but are inferior to the saturnine solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="388"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a></span></p>

<p>Ether, applied with a pencil to the
part, is also sometimes of service.</p>

<p>Sea salt, mixed with bile, has been recommended,
but has very little effect.</p>

<p>Camphorated liniment is very frequently
used, in which case the part is
generally kept warm with flannel. It
does not, however, appear to possess any
very great power of discussing these tumors;
but the friction which is made
use of with these sometimes hastens the
removal of these tumors, and may be
usefully alternated with the use of the
saturnine lotion. A mixture of ether and
linimentum opiatum may be employed
for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Hemlock poultices were at one time
in repute, but they have now lost their
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="389"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a></span></p>

<p>By these means, even after a small
quantity of matter is formed in the gland
or tumor, we may discuss the tumor, or
make it less; but, if the quantity of matter
should continue to augment, we may
consider resolution as out of the question.
Our object must then be to bring the
part to suppuration as quickly as possible;
because we not only thus shorten a
process which must be completed before
the parts can be healed, but also render
the ulcerative action more healthy, and
easier induced; for the more quickly
that the suppurative action is performed,
the sooner does the ulcerative action take
place, and the more vigorous is it, provided
that no new cause render it unhealthy,
as has formerly been mentioned.</p>

<p>This advice, however, must not be
adopted without some exceptions, and
must be chiefly confined to affections of<span class="pagenum" title="390"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a></span>
the glands and cellular substance, and
ought not to be extended to the joints.
In these cases, even although a small
quantity of matter form, we ought still
to endeavour to prevent general suppuration,
and the bursting of an abscess;
because this would, instead of accelerating
the cure, as is frequently the effect
in the other case, be attended with dangerous
consequences; we must therefore
rather continue the use of the issues,
and endeavour to procure the
absorption of what matter is already
formed.</p>

<p>The means employed for promoting
suppuration were formerly poultices of lily
roots, honey, &amp;c. alternated with fomentations
prepared from pomegranate seeds,
and myrrh, and cypress leaves, or, occasionally,
stimulating plasters; but now the
common bread and milk poultice is advantageously<span class="pagenum" title="391"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a></span>
substituted in place of these
remedies. When the process is very tedious,
electricity is useful along with the
poultices.</p>

<p>When these tumors have suppurated
freely, and an abscess occupies the whole
of the gland, it is useful to evacuate the
matter by a small opening with a lancet,
if there be no appearance of the abscess
bursting quickly, and the sooner this is
done the better. When this is done, a
poultice should be applied until next
day, the part is then to be wiped clean
and dry, and a small bit of lint, spread
with simple ointment, applied on the orifice.
The surrounding red skin is to be
dulled with powdered <span class="nowrap">cerussa<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span>, and then<span class="pagenum" title="392"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a></span>
covered with dry lint. A compress is to
be laid over the whole, and moderate
pressure employed. These applications
are to be renewed every day, or twice
a-day, according to the quantity of the
discharge, and other circumstances; and,
at each dressing, the parts may be bathed
with spirit of wine. If this mode of
dressing does not produce a cure, but the
opening enlarges, and the surface ulcerates,
we must then employ the dressings
for a scrophulous sore.</p>

<p>When, notwithstanding the use of
issues, matter is formed in joints, or,
when these fail to procure the absorption
of what was formed before they were
introduced, then one of two things must<span class="pagenum" title="393"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a></span>
happen; either the abscess must be punctured,
or it must be allowed to burst of
its own accord. In general, I believe,
it is most advantageous to allow the abscess
to burst, without any interference,
except the continuance of the issue, or
the establishment of such new ones as
circumstances, particularly the situation
of the pain, may point out. If, however,
it were at any time deemed proper to
evacuate the matter, this ought to be
done with a small trocar, at different
times, in the manner recommended by
Mr. Abernethy for the cure of lumber
abscess. This is infinitely preferable to
the barbarous practice which even some
surgeons high in reputation advise and
make use of, I mean the insertion of a
seton through the abscess of the <span class="nowrap">joint<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="394"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a></span></p>
<p>When the scrophulous suppuration
ends in the ulcerative action, the cure is
generally tedious. It is even doubted
by some how far it is safe to attempt a
speedy termination to the ulcer, as it is
supposed, that, in this case, the disease
may be driven to some other part: And
so fearful are they of this dreadful event,
that they are careful, by issues and new
artificial sores, to continue the discharge
after the original ulcer is healed.</p>

<p>If I have been right in my view of
this disease, it will appear, that this reasoning
is false, and that the practice is
both useless and troublesome. Even those
who propose and defend the practice, do
so not upon the principles of reason and
judgment, or from logical deductions
from the theory which they give of the
disease, but upon imaginary apprehensions.
We find, for instance, Mr. Bell<span class="pagenum" title="395"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a></span>
saying, that, “till the disease is eradicated
from the habit, all that should
in general be done to the sores, is, to
give as free and open vent to the
matter as <span class="nowrap">possible<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span>.” From this, we
should, without doubt, expect, that he
considered scrophula as dependent upon
some peculiar humour which was to be
expelled; but just before we are told,
that this disease depends upon debility,
particularly of the lymphatic system; a
condition which it is not customary to
talk of eradicating, or rooting out, or expelling.
Upon the common principles of
reasoning, Mr. Bell ought only to have
forbid healing the sores, until the system
was strengthened, otherwise the weakness
would be driven or determined to
some other part.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="396"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a></span></p>
<p>Moderate pressure, by means of adhesive
plaster, conjoined with the application
of cold water, is one of the best
remedies for the mild scrophulous ulcer,
when it is situated so, that this can be
used. When it is not, then dusting the
part thickly with cerussa, containing a
sixth part of powdered alum, may be had
recourse to. A piece of dry lint is next
to be applied, and a compress bound
down, with such pressure as can be used.
It is sometimes useful to dip the compress
in cold water, and renew it frequently.</p>

<p>The ceratum e lapide calaminari forms
a very good dressing for this sore, when it
is intended to leave it to follow its own
course.</p>

<p>As a stimulant, the unguentum resinorum,
either alone, or mixed with red<span class="pagenum" title="397"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a></span>
precipitate, is often used; but it seldom
is of service, and often makes the sore irritable.
If, however, the ulcer become
very indolent, this, or the citrine ointment,
properly <span class="nowrap">diluted<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span>, may be of service.
The same may be said of the
other common stimulating applications.</p>

<p>Poultices made of bread and sea
water have been recommended, but
seem to possess little power of accelerating
the cure.</p>

<p>Solutions of alum, of blue vitriol,
corrosive <span class="nowrap">sublimate<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span>, of the nitrites of<span class="pagenum" title="398"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a></span>
copper, bismuth, and silver, are sometimes
useful to wash the sore with.</p>

<p>The recent leaves of the wood sorrel
bruised, and applied raw to the sore, is
sometimes useful. The same may be
said of cloths dipped in lemon juice, or
vinegar and water.</p>

<p>Saturnine ointment is much employed
by some, for abating heat and
pain; but is inferior to compresses dipped
in cold water.</p>

<p>Sometimes only the anterior part of
a scrophulous tumor suppurates and ulcerates,
and the deeper part of it remains<span class="pagenum" title="399"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a></span>
swelled and hard. In this case, the bottom
is generally covered with a slough,
which comes slowly away piecemeal, and
is renewed for some time, until the tumor
subsides, partly by sloughing, partly by
absorption, and partly by the subsidence
of the remaining inflammatory action.
In this case, sprinkling the surface lightly
with precipitate, or blue vitriol, is of
service; and this may be alternated with
the common warm poultice. When the
surface becomes cleaner, dry lint forms a
very good dressing; and this may be covered
with a pledget of linen spread
with cerate. Afterwards pressure is useful.</p>

<p>The irritable overacting sore, or what
has been called the struma maligna, is
very difficult to manage, especially as it
is frequently connected with a diseased
state of the bones or tendons below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="400"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a></span></p>

<p>The hepatized ammonia, diluted in
the manner formerly mentioned, or simple
ointment, mixed with opium, are
sometimes of use.</p>

<p>Poultices of bitter almonds, beat up
with a little olive oil into a fine pulp, and
then warmed, occasionally relieve the
pain, and make the ulcer more healthy.</p>

<p>Carrot poultices, or warm poultices
made of bread and strong decoction of
camomile flowers, are also sometimes of
use.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid gas, or carbonated
hydrogene, are sometimes of temporary,
rarely of permanent advantage.</p>

<p>Anodynes, internally, are useful here,
as in other painful sores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="401"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a></span></p>

<p>In all cases of scrophulous inflammation
or ulceration, it is useful to exhibit,
alongst with the proper local treatment,
such internal medicines, and to attend to
the constitution, in such respects as may
be deemed proper. Upon these points I
have already made some observations.</p>

<p>When the local disease cannot be
cured, and has induced the scrophulous
hectic; when this cannot be removed by
the means commonly employed, and
which have been mentioned in the dissertation
on simple inflammation, then
the diseased part must be removed, if its
situation permit. This must not, however,
be rashly done, but must be delayed
until we ascertain, that our remedies,
general and local, (which must be used
with assiduity and care), are of no avail.
It is not sufficient that the hectic continues,
and that other appearances are almost<span class="pagenum" title="402"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a></span>
stationary; they ought to be augmenting,
in order to justify amputation
of a useful and important part; because
every practitioner must have observed
the recoveries which take place, even after
the hectic fever has made considerable
progress. On the other hand, we
must not allow the constitution to suffer
too much, but must interfere, whenever
we perceive that our labours are fruitless,
and that the hectic is regularly and progressively
increasing, and the strength
sinking. When this is observed, the only
chance for life is an operation; and
every day this is delayed adds to the risk
attending it; for there is a degree of injury,
more than which the constitution
cannot sustain, and which will prove fatal,
even although the exciting cause be
removed. To fix the proper period requires
judgment in the surgeon; but he
may be enabled to do so, by attending<span class="pagenum" title="403"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a></span>
carefully to the state of all the symptoms;
for whenever these continue progressively
to become worse, and have reduced
the patient already to a state of
weakness, which cannot be much increased
without danger, he may consider
it as impossible to delay amputation
longer with any hopes of success.</p>

<p>Having made these observations on
this species of scrophula, I shall now conclude,
by shortly mentioning the mode
of treatment adopted by the older practitioners.</p>

<p>Bleeding, which at first was made
use of according to the custom of the
day, was soon laid aside, on observing,
that, in many cases, it was manifestly
hurtful, and in every instance useless.
But although the plan of general depletion
was given up, yet local evacuations<span class="pagenum" title="404"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a></span>
were much insisted on; for they held it
as absolutely requisite, that the brain
should be purged of its pituita, (the redundancy
of which produced the disease),
by errhines, fomentations to the
ears, and the application of issues and sinapisms
to the head. The stomach was
cleared of viscosities, by emetics of mustard
or broom-seed; the bowels, by aloes;
and the skin and kidneys, by sudorifics
and diaphoretics.</p>

<p>Having thus procured a sufficient evacuation,
the patient was desired to
smell a pomum odoratum, composed of
styrax, amber, myrrh, aloes, and many
other ingredients; the vapours of which
were supposed to get up to the anterior
ventricles of the brain, and dry them.
Hunger and thirst, by drying the juices,
were decreed to be salutary. Every
thing was rendered nauseous with me<span class="pagenum" title="405"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a></span>dicine.
The bread was seasoned with
anise and fœnugrek seeds, and the drink
consisted of decoctions of guaiac and
mastic wood, which last was “a friend to
the brain and <span class="nowrap">viscera<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span>.” As a condiment
to these medicated meals, Arnoldus
de Villa Nova treated his patients to the
burnt sponge, mixed with salt and pepper.</p>

<p>But these, and indeed all the medicines
yielded by the materia medica,
were considered as trifling, and of no avail,
when compared to the miraculous
power possessed by the king, who, with
one touch of his hand, could banish this
dreadful disorder, and dry up all the
sores. So valuable did this royal prerogative
appear in the eyes of many, that it
became a national controversy, whether<span class="pagenum" title="406"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a></span>
it belonged to the French or English;
whilst the Romish and Protestant churches
reciprocally urged this prerogative of
the king of the country where they were
established, as a manifestation from heaven
of the justice of their cause.</p>

<p>In France, the king touched publicly,
at four dated feasts in the year, preparing
himself the day before by prayer and
fasting; then entering the apartment
where the sick were arranged, the patients
were individually presented by the chief
physician to his majesty, who placed his
hand upon their head, pronouncing these
words, “Le Roy te touch, et Dieu te guarit.”
The sick then retire, and soon find a
manifest amendment. “In some the ulcers
dry up; in others the swellings diminish;
and, wonderful to relate, in a
few days, more than 500 out of 1000
are perfectly cured!”&mdash;<span class="pagenum" title="407"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a></span>“Hic hœrant
philosophi, cœcutiunt medici, stupet
prophanum vulgus.”</p>

<p>Upon reading these accounts, we smile
at the credulity of mankind; but we pity
them, when we learn, that near a thousand
every year made weary and expensive
pilgrimages, from very distant countries,
to purchase this imaginary benefit.</p>

<h2>DISSERTATION VI.</h2>
</div>

<h3><i>On the Cancerous Inflammation.</i></h3>


<p>The cancerous inflammation generally
comes in slowly, in some glandular part,
which becomes rather harder, and somewhat
<span class="nowrap">larger<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span>, than it ought to be; but
the pain, for the most part, at first is
trifling. By degrees, both the hardness
and swelling increase, and a pain, like
the pricking of needles, is felt in the
part. This pain, after some time, becomes<span class="pagenum" title="409"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a></span>
more violent, darting through the
whole of the gland, and leaving a sensation,
as if the part had been rudely
wrung or twisted. The tumor still remains
moveable under the skin, which
is of the natural colour; but when the
disease has continued a little longer,
a greater degree of inflammation takes
place, and adhesions are formed betwixt
the skin and the gland, or the gland and
the parts below, at the same time that
the pain becomes more continued. The
skin now becomes puckered, or drawn
inward, and of a dirty or leaden hue,
which in time acquires more of the red,
but is never of a bright colour. The
veins are varicose, and the tumor is,
with difficulty, moveable. When the
skin becomes red, we may be able to discern
a superficial fluctuation, which proceeds
from part of the gland forming an<span class="pagenum" title="410"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a></span>
<span class="nowrap">abscess<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span>. This at last bursts, and discharges
a thin yellowish matter, which
frequently oozes out in very considerable
quantity; the orifice enlarges, and the
sore penetrates, for a little way downward,
pretty rapidly, and the edges become
hard, and overlap a small part of
the disk of the sore; but, soon after this,
a fungus rises up; and although, in some
places, the ulcer may become deeper, yet
its chief progress is laterally.</p>

<p>The cancerous ulcer increases more
or less rapidly, and is soon attended
with a burning pain; the surface is unequal,
excavations appearing in some<span class="pagenum" title="411"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a></span>
parts, whilst in others a fungus rises up.
The colour is brown, but glistening or
fiery. The granulations very soft and
indistinct. A thin ichor, of an abominable
fœtor, is discharged in great plenty,
mixed with blood; whilst, in many parts,
small pellicles, like lymphatic exsudations,
cover the sore. The surrounding skin is
of a dark purple colour, and the adjacent
parts very hard. The margins, which
at first were overlapping the sore, in the
course of a few days are uniformly elevated,
and frequently retorted and unequal,
as if they had been bitten by an
animal; and over these the fungus frequently
shoots or protrudes, so that the
sore assumes the appearance of a cauliflower.
This ulcer bleeds a little upon
the slightest touch, so that at every dressing
the cloths are generally bloody;
but, at times, this bleeding is more alarming,
proceeding from the bursting<span class="pagenum" title="412"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a></span>
of the diseased veins. These hemorrhages
are, in some instances, very frequent,
and reduce the patient to the
greatest weakness. Sometimes they suddenly
relieve the unhappy persons from
all their woe.</p>

<p>Some time after the abscess forms,
and frequently before ulceration takes
place, the neighbouring lymphatic glands
swell, and become affected with a similar
action, and follow the same course with
the original sore; only in them the progress
is generally more rapid.</p>

<p>After ulceration takes place, sometimes
before it, if the abscess be considerable,
hectic fever takes place; the countenance
becomes sallow and unhealthy;
the pulse quickens, and becomes small
and sharp; the strength fails; night<span class="pagenum" title="413"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a></span>
sweats come on, and colliquative diarrhœa
hastens death.</p>

<p>The parts in which cancer most frequently
appears, are the under lip, the
breasts of women, and the testicles of
men: But there is no one part of the
body in which it may not occur, although
most frequently it is, in its original
attacks, confined to secreting
glands.</p>

<p>In the breasts, parotid glands, and
some other conglomerate glands, the
disease begins as has been described;
but on the skin, and in some other
parts, the progress is somewhat different.
The skin, particularly that of the face,
is apt to have a small chronic pustule
formed on it, by the inflammation of
one of the sebaceous glands, which, by
degrees, becomes harder, firmer, and<span class="pagenum" title="414"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a></span>
more elevated. Soon afterwards, it becomes
rough, and of a warty appearance:
It then ulcerates on the surface.
This is covered with a scale or scab,
which repeatedly falls off, and forms
again upon the part, until it assume the
appearance and character of the cancerous
sore. But, more frequently, the disease
is not allowed to follow this progress, the
wart either being rubbed off accidentally,
or removed by ignorant persons.
The part then forms a superficial ulcer,
which is slightly hollowed. It is of a
glistening flabby appearance, and the margins
are hard, tumid, and a little turned
back: But after the disease has continued
some time, the flabby appearance
of the sore is converted into fungus.
We may, therefore, from this, and other
cases, conclude, that cancerous ulcers,
which are formed without previous ab<span class="pagenum" title="415"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a></span>scess,
form fungus more slowly than
those which are formed with them.</p>

<p>When the lips become cancerous,
there is generally first perceived an indurated
lump, of greater or less bulk.
The skin over it becomes tender, frets,
and is covered with a scurf or scab,
which gradually becomes elevated. Part
falls occasionally off, but it is soon replaced.
This by degrees extends itself
over the prolabium, and, after some
time, falls off entirely, leaving the part
with all the common characters of the
cancerous ulcer. The pain is burning.</p>

<p>When the testicle becomes cancerous,
it sometimes follows the common course
of cancer in other glands, beginning with
hardness and shooting pain in some part
of the testicles or epidydimis, which gradually
forms an abscess, and ulcerates.<span class="pagenum" title="416"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a></span>
But, at other times, soon after the testicle
becomes diseased, an effusion takes place
within the tunica vaginalis. In this case,
the disease of the testicle becomes complicated
with hydrocele. It is distinguished
by our feeling the hardness of the
epidydimis behind, or the hardness and
inequality of the testicle, when the water
is drawn off. It likewise, after some
continuance, becomes more painful than
a common case of hydrocele. If the testicle
be not extirpated in due time, the
cord becomes hard and swelled, and
comes to ulcerate.</p>

<p>Cancer in the penis generally begins
by a kind of warty tumor, and follows
the course of cancer in the face. Sometimes
the penis becomes just like a cauliflower,
a large fungus extending from
its ulcerated extremity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="417"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a></span></p>

<p>The uterus, in elderly women, is very
frequently affected with <span class="nowrap">cancer<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span>. It
begins with a feeling of weight and uneasiness
in the lower part of the belly,
and the natural discharge of the parts is
increased, so that the disease passes for
fluor albus. By examination, however,
we may generally discover a hardness,
and sometimes an inequality, about the
os uteri, and may discover the uterus
to be unequally enlarged. After some
time, ulceration takes place, and matter,
mixed with a bloody fluid, is discharged.<span class="pagenum" title="418"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a></span>
Occasionally, considerable hemorrhages
take place, which are not unfrequently
confounded with menorrhagia; but it
may be distinguished by the continued
discharge of a bloody sanies during the
intervals of the hemorrhage; by the
continual pain, and especially by our
feeling the projection of the os uteri into
the vagina, in some places hard, and
in others soft, but rough, which shows
ulceration. After some time, the glands
about the vagina swell; and that canal,
in many places, becomes considerably
straitened. Hectic terminates the sufferings
of the patient. On opening the
body, we find the uterus generally
though not always, considerably enlarged,
with abscess and ulcers in different
parts of its substance. These ulcers, as
well as those of the ovarium, and, so far
as I know, every gland in the internal<span class="pagenum" title="419"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a></span>
cavities of the body, have a less tendency
to fungate, than cancerous ulcer on the
surface of the body.</p>

<p>When inflammation attacks any organ,
or part of the body, and leaves a
chronic tumor, this may assume, as will
afterwards be mentioned, a new inflammation,
and may become affected with
cancer; though it more frequently happens,
that it assumes the pseudo-cancerous
action. The symptoms and progress
of cancer are much the same here
as in the breast.</p>

<p>When the eye becomes cancerous, it,
unless the disease begins in one of the
glands, such as the lachrymal, or those
of Meibomius, is first of all affected with
simple inflammation, which destroys the
whole texture of the eye, and makes it
of a different structure, rather resembling<span class="pagenum" title="420"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a></span>
a confused mass than a well organised
body. The lucid cornea becomes opake,
and protrudes; the eye enlarges,
is affected with a violent deep-seated
pain, and at last bursts, generally on the
apex: From this a fungous substance
protrudes, which manifests all the symptoms
of the cancerous ulcer, and in a
short time arrives at a great size.</p>

<p>When the nose becomes cancerous,
the disease either begins in the outside,
with a small tumor or wart, as in other
parts of the face, or within, by a firm
and somewhat painful polypous projection,
which frets on the surface, and
soon assumes the cancerous ulceration.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of this disease is of the
utmost importance; because if we mistake
cancer for some other disease, we
not only neglect the proper practice, but<span class="pagenum" title="421"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a></span>
frequently are led to prescribe remedies
which do infinite harm. If, on the contrary,
we mistake another disease for
cancer, we neglect the necessary means
of cure, and may even be led to extirpate
a part which might be easily cured by
gentler treatment.</p>

<p>Cancer may be confounded with
scrophula, syphilis, and some other affections,
which have received no particular
name.</p>

<p>There is an <span class="nowrap">affection<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> which begins
like cancer, by a hard schirrus, either
of a gland, or still more frequently
of one of the chronic tumors, which has
been already mentioned as succeeding
slow inflammation. This remains, for a<span class="pagenum" title="422"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a></span>
considerable time, hard, and free from
pain, and there is no puckering of the
skin over it. By degrees, some part of
the surface becomes of a purple or livid
colour, and ulcerates. This ulcer remains
long superficial; the edges are
hard and rounded; the discharge is
thin; the surface is glossy, and no distinct
granulations can be seen; the pain is
slightly smarting, but not burning, and
instead of being fungous, the sore is
slightly hollowed out below the level of
the surrounding skin. By the continuance
of this affection, the gland is apt to
shrink and diminish in size; and generally
where this takes place, the sore contracts
and heals with a very puckered
unequal cicatrix, having, in some places,
a thick dark coloured scab covering <span class="nowrap">it<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span>.<span class="pagenum" title="423"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a></span>
The neighbouring glands become affected;
but they are soft, and rather resemble
the spongoid inflammation than
schirrous hardness: But I have never
had an opportunity of observing them
proceed the length of ulceration. If
the continuance of the sore be long,
the constitution is affected, and the patient
becomes <span class="nowrap">hectic<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span>. This kind of ulcer
may be distinguished from cancer, if
we attend to the absence of the fungous,<span class="pagenum" title="424"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a></span>
and peculiar appearance of the cancerous
sore, and the want of the burning pain:
But, before ulceration takes place, the
two diseases may be confounded; because
there are no certain characteristics
of schirro-cancer.</p>

<p>This disease may attack the uterus,
and is very apt to be confounded with
cancer; nor is it easy to distinguish
them, as the parts are unseen. There
is never much enlargement. The ulcer
is pretty smooth, and the margins circular,
hard, and glabrous. The pain is not
very considerable. The discharge is thin,
copious, and of a yellowish colour, but
seldom bloody, unless when the disease
has continued very long.</p>

<p>The spongoid inflammation has been
considered as cancerous by those who
have seen it; but the distinction betwixt<span class="pagenum" title="425"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a></span>
the two is sufficiently obvious: The one
begins with a spongy elastic tumor, the
other with a firm hard lump.</p>

<p>Scrophula may be mistaken for cancer,
when it appears in one of the secretory
glands, such as the breasts; at least
as long as it remains without ulceration.
But the tumor generally enlarges more
rapidly than cancerous tumors, at least
such as are not very painful. It is pretty
soft and doughy, the pain is inconsiderable,
and we may generally perceive the
marks of a scrophulous habit. When ulceration
takes place, the opening is, for some
time, sinous, and the matter discharged is
curdy, and without fœtor. When the ulceration
extends along the skin, it has
not the fungous appearance of cancer, but
the aspect of a scrophulous sore, and the
gland below appears sloughy. The pain<span class="pagenum" title="426"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a></span>
is not very considerable, and is not
the burning kind.</p>

<p>Scrophulous inflammation may also
attack the uterus, bladder, and any of
the internal organs. The uterus and
bladder become thickened, and contain
abscesses in different parts, which point
on the surface of these viscera. They
are filled with a thick white cheesy-looking
matter; and when they burst,
they produce ulcers, with a foul surface,
and having the margins notched, and
lying for a considerable way over the
disk of the sore.</p>

<p>The distinction betwixt cancer and
the venereal ulcer is so very striking,
that it is scarcely possible for these diseases
to be mistaken for each other, if
the discriminating marks of each be attended
to. The cancerous sore is always<span class="pagenum" title="427"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a></span>
dark coloured; the surface fiery, yet of
a fungous nature; the discharge foul,
and of an intolerable smell; and the bottom
and surrounding parts are hard and
painful. If there be not an open running
sore, the part is covered with a dry
elevated scab, of a dark colour; the skin
around this is livid, and the neighbouring
parts indurated. The base of the
venereal sore is much softer, the discharge
is of a different nature, and its aspect
so peculiarly unlike the cancerous
sore, that it is impossible to confound
<span class="nowrap">them<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="428"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a></span></p>
<p>There is another disease, which is
very apt to be confounded with cancer,
and which, at one period, resembles it
very much. It begins with a small tumor,
like a phlegmon, of a dull colour,
and without much pain. This soon assumes
a soft elastic feel, and bursts at
the top; a bloody matter oozes out, the
lips of the orifice become tumid, and the
integuments ulcerate. The whole has a
convex surface, the ulcerated part being
most prominent; and the sloping margins
are red and painful: The ulcer itself<span class="pagenum" title="429"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a></span>
is foul, of a dark fungous appearance,
and covered with thick offensive matter,
with sloughs in different parts; the margins
are hard, and lie, in a serrated manner,
over part of the sore: The pain is
smarting. This sometimes spreads to a
considerable extent, and cuts off the patient.
At other times, by the use of mild
dressings, good diet, and opium internally,
the fungous surface sloughs off by degrees,
and shows a smooth red bottom, somewhat
striated, and of a glossy appearance,
which contracts, and scabs over,
like the pseudo-cancer. The fungus, in
this ulcer, never rises high; it is generally
slightly convex, being most prominent
at the centre, and has never the
retorted trumpet-like appearance of some
cancers.</p>

<p>Phagedena has sometimes, particularly
on the yard, been confounded with<span class="pagenum" title="430"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a></span>
the cancerous sore. It has indeed the
brown fiery colour, and smarting pain,
possessed by the cancerous ulcer; but it
wants the fungous appearance, which
the cancer very soon assumes. It spreads
with greater rapidity, and is not surrounded
by the same hardness. It begins
likewise more suddenly, and without
any previous hard tumor. We frequently
hear of venereal buboes becoming
cancerous; but this seldom, if ever,
happens; and phagedena has, in this
case, been confounded with cancer; for
that spreading fiery honey-comb-like ulcer,
which venereal buboes sometimes
turn into, is evidently of the phagedenic
nature.</p>

<p>It was from allowing too great latitude
to the description or definition of
cancer, as well as from the numerous divisions
admitted by the older writers, such<span class="pagenum" title="431"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a></span>
as mild, raging, and the like, that many
diseases have come to be considered as
cancerous, which are in their nature
perhaps radically different from it.</p>

<p>The mild cancer was said to begin slowly,
with little pain, to continue long indolent,
and to ulcerate slowly: The ulcer was
not very painful, and frequently healed
with a scab, or remained long stationary.
This evidently was not a cancerous disease,
but the one which I have described
above. On cutting into this tumor, after
extirpation, we find it to be of a firm
texture, the interstices filled with a kind
oily matter, and no cavities with thickened
sides in its substance.</p>

<p>The malignant, or true cancer, begins
with a hard schirrous tumor, with frequent
lancinating pain; the skin soon
adheres to the gland, and becomes slightly<span class="pagenum" title="432"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a></span>
puckered, and of a livid or leaden
colour; the veins are more or less varicose,
although the tumor be not large;
and the nipple, when the disease is in
the breast, is generally drawn inward.
The integuments next become red, and
a small opening forms, through which is
discharged a bloody serous-looking matter,
generally in very considerable quantities.
The ulcer which succeeds this is,
at first, superficial, affecting only that
part of the integuments which covered
the pointing of the glandular cyst or abscess.
It is dark coloured and fiery,
like phagedena; but the edges are hard
and ragged, and overlap irregularly, in
different spots, small parts of the surface
of the sore. In the course, however,
of a few days, sometimes in a few
hours, a fungus protrudes, and increases
more or less rapidly, at the same time
that the sore spreads laterally. This<span class="pagenum" title="433"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a></span>
fungus is very irregular, of a dark colour,
and covered with sloughy-looking
pellicles. It generally sprouts out most
toward the circumference, so that the
sore has often the appearance of the
mouth of a trumpet; or if the cavity in
the middle be less, the fungus being less
turned out, it resembles a cauliflower.
This fungus uniformly projects over the
margins, which are hard and red. The
matter discharged is thin, bloody, and
exceedingly fœtid. On examining these
glands, we find them, in the commencement,
to be hard, like a substance intermediate
betwixt gland and cartilage, and
of an indistinct granulated structure.
Soon afterwards, we perceive small abscesses
or cavities in different parts, which
are filled with a serous fluid, and the
sides of which are hard and firm, like
gristle. These enlarge gradually, and
new ones form; so that were we to cut<span class="pagenum" title="434"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a></span>
the gland, we should find it containing a
great number of these <span class="nowrap">cavities<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span>. Those
which are nearest the surface of the
gland, generally enlarge most; and sometimes
only one gains any considerable
size. Before this bursts, its sides become
more opake, and more blended with the
rest of the gland, (which, where it surrounds
the abscess, becomes softer, rather
more vascular, and more porous or
spongy than in other parts, and than
it formerly was), unless it distend beyond
the substance of the gland, pushing the
skin outward. In this case, when it
bursts, a great quantity of lymphatic
matter is discharged, and the part collapses,
and then exhibits the usual appearances<span class="pagenum" title="435"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a></span>
of the cancerous ulceration: But,
more frequently, we find the abscess remain
altogether in the gland, and only
distend the skin a little at the apex,
where it points. When the abscess bursts,
more or less fluid is discharged, and immediately
the inner surface begins, like
the orifice, to ulcerate. A fungus is produced
from the sides of the abscess,
which fills up the cavity, and then protrudes
from the orifice. We, therefore,
find, that when the cancerous abscess
bursts, the orifice at first assumes the appearance
of a cancer which begins in
the <span class="nowrap">cutis<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span>; but very soon a fungus pro<span class="pagenum" title="436"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a></span>trudes,
and the ulcer gradually becomes
more convex, or more like a cauliflower.</p>

<p>These abscesses, with thick sides, are
characteristic of cancer, and are never
found wanting in a cancerous gland.
When they are not present, we may be
certain, that the tumor is a different
kind of schirrus. But although these be
always found in the glands, and form in
them a certain mark of cancer, yet they
are not necessary to the existence of that
disease; for the cancerous ulcer, like
common ulcers, may begin without previous
abscess, as we observe in the cancer
of the skin, which, in nine cases out
of ten, begins with excrescences like
warts.</p>

<p>By attending to these circumstances,
we may generally form a pretty just
diagnosis. At the same time, it must<span class="pagenum" title="437"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a></span>
be admitted, that, occasionally, cases do
occur, in which it is impossible to deliver
a decided opinion: Nor is it doubtful,
that many ulcers are considered as
cancerous, which are of a different nature,
and some of which admit of a
cure. In forming our judgment, we
must be directed by the nature of the
first symptoms, and the history of the
schirrous stage; by the appearance and
aspect of the fungus, and the other circumstances
which have been already described.</p>

<p>Concerning the peculiar state of the
parts in cancer, or the proximate cause,
many opinions have prevailed; but these,
however they might differ in certain
points, have almost unanimously agreed
in admitting obstruction as the chief
cause of this disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="438"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a></span></p>

<p>Until lately, the melancholic humour
was supposed to be the fluid which was
obstructed, and accumulated, in consequence
of which it fermented, and produced
a burning ulcer; and whatever
promoted the generation of this humour,
was currently admitted as a remote cause
of cancer. Women, says Ambrose Paré,
are more subject to schirrus than men;
“because their liver is warmer, and their
spleen being weaker, is less able to
purge the blood of choler.” Grief and
chagrin, by promoting the formation of
this fiery fluid, were accordingly considered
by the celebrated Heister, as very
apt to induce the “cancerous diathesis;”
and he slyly adds, by way of corollary,
that “old maids, and women who do
not breed, are very subject to cancer in
the <span class="nowrap">breast<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="439"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a></span></p>
<p>Concerning the particular changes
which took place in the nature of this
obstructed humour, many different opinions
prevailed. Some thought it necessary,
that the black bile should be
charged with an acid, and that this produced
ulceration, when “its sharp cutting
points had surmounted and destroyed
the volatile smegmatic and balsamic
salts of the blood.” Others conjectured,
that by an “adustion or over-concoction,”
it grew sharp and burning:
But Wiseman observes, that it is
more probable that it becomes somewhat
arsenical. It would, however, be useless
to enumerate the different changes which
this imaginary humour was supposed to
undergo. It is sufficient to observe, that
these were almost universally believed to
depend upon the previous stagnation, in
consequence of obstruction; and this
leading point has uniformly been insisted<span class="pagenum" title="440"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a></span>
on by every succeeding author, whatever
might have been his particular notion
with regard to the nature of the obstructed
fluid, whether bile, blood, or
lymph; and even the anatomical structure
of the part has been brought in support
of the doctrine of obstruction. One
of the latest <span class="nowrap">writers<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span>, though he talks
nothing of “coagulating <span class="nowrap">acids<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span>,” yet insists
fully on this mechanical cause as the
origin of cancer; “for,” says he, “the
circulation in the glands being carried
on by a set of vessels much more minute
than those with which other
parts of the body are supplied, (let
this be proved), obstruction will much
more readily and easily occur in them
than in other parts.”&mdash;“When the<span class="pagenum" title="441"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a></span>
substance of a gland happens to be the
part, a determination is made to this,
being neither, as is found by experience,
so proper as the cellular substance,
or the formation of pus, nor,
from its <span class="nowrap">softness<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span>, so susceptible of inflammation,
as a membrane; an indolent
hard swelling, called a schirrus,
comes, merely by the <i>obstruction</i>
and <span class="nowrap"><i>distension</i><a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> of its different vessels,
very naturally to be produced.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="442"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a></span></p>

<p>Some surgeons, perhaps from a desire
of singularity, or from a defect of
their organs of sight, declared, that they
had detected little worms in the parts,
which, eating it up, produced all the
disagreeable symptoms of cancer; and
that to their introduction the disease
was owing. The cure which they confidently
proposed, was applying a piece of
cold veal to the part, which would tempt
the animals to quit their devastation.
Others, perhaps originally from ridicule,
though latterly in sober earnest, told
their readers, that there were no worms,
but a little wolf in the part, which
might be made occasionally to show its
head, by holding a piece of meat before
the ulcer.</p>

<p>Strange as this doctrine of living
creatures producing cancer may appear,
it is nevertheless adopted by a late very<span class="pagenum" title="443"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a></span>
ingenious writer. When hydatids find
their way into “a solid substance,” the
consequence, in his opinion, will be cancer;
and the success of an operation will,
he conjectures, depend, in a great measure,
upon these animals being confined
in a common cyst, for then they may
be all removed; whereas, if they be unconnected,
some of the smaller ones may
be allowed to <span class="nowrap">remain<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span>. From the surface
of the cyst, which contains the animal,
a fungus shoots out, and thus acts
as a barrier between it and the skin; or,
if the animal have been in the stomach,
it separates it from the coats of that viscus,
“preventing suppuration in the one
instance, and absorption in the <span class="nowrap">other<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span>.”
This suppuration, “and <span class="pagenum" title="444"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a></span>disposition
to fungate before the skin is
broken,” if I understand him, is produced
by the death of the animal; for,
says he, “if hydatids possess the principle
vitality during their transparent
state, and their opacity is the effect of
the loss of that principle, would they
not, in the latter stage, stimulate the
part in which they are situated to suppuration,
as we find the case with the
Guinea worm when <span class="nowrap">dead<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span>?” Concerning
the manner in which these animals
produce the symptoms of cancer,
we are told, that “this enlargement of a
foreign body, in a solid substance, and
so extremely sensible as the breast, cannot
but be attended with intense pain,
and frequent <span class="nowrap">inflammation<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span>.” A doctrine<span class="pagenum" title="445"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a></span>
not far removed from that taught
in the humoural schools, which maintained,
that the coagulation and inspissation
of the fluids distended the follicles of the
glands, producing many cavities, and
much <span class="nowrap">pain<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span>.</p>

<p>That hydatids <i>may</i> be formed on a
cancerous gland, I shall not dispute; but
that they are generally to be met with,
or are in any respect essential to the disease,
I cannot admit. In all the cancerous
breasts, testicles, and tumors, which I
have examined, I never saw any thing
which could be considered distinctly as a
hydatid; so that I suspect, that under
this name have been described the small
cancerous abscesses, with thick cartilaginous
sides, which we so universally meet
with in schirro-cancerous glands. We<span class="pagenum" title="446"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a></span>
likewise find cancer take place in circumstances
in which no hydatids can be
found. Thus, for instance, a cancerous
wart being knocked off the face, a cancerous
ulcer is produced; but no hydatid
is to be found at the base of the wart
to produce this.</p>

<p>When cancer has continued some time,
it was believed that the matter was absorbed,
taken into the blood, and that
all the humours were speedily assimilated;
and it was by this absorption and
assimilation that they explained the fatal
and rapid progress of relapses, after
an apparent cure had been obtained.
That matter is absorbed, is an undeniable
fact; but the only effect which is
produced by this, is on the lymphatic
<span class="nowrap">glands<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span>, which intervene betwixt the sore<span class="pagenum" title="447"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a></span>
and the heart; for, beyond these, the
matter does not pass qua virus, but is
changed in its nature and properties, as
is the case with every other part or production
of the animal, which is absorbed
and formed into part of the blood.
Neither cancerous matter, nor variolous
matter, nor syphilitic matter, ever are
formed in the blood, or ever can enter
into it, unless by means of an wounded
vessel. This point I shall consider more
fully, when I come to treat of the venereal
inflammation. Here I shall only observe,
that were the reverse true, then
the contagious matter must pass through<span class="pagenum" title="448"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a></span>
every gland, and every portion of the
human form, in as much as the blood
circulates in every point; and, therefore,
every spot should become diseased,
and every part, in the same circumstances,
should become diseased at the same
<span class="nowrap">moment<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span>. Disease is not spread in the
living system mechanically, by the absorption
of matter, which is conveyed
over the whole body, but by the sympathetic
connection of parts, which has
been already explained, and which will
afterwards be farther illustrated. It is<span class="pagenum" title="449"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a></span>
in consequence of this, that a distant
part shall become diseased, and yet all
the rest remain healthy; and even where
every part becomes affected, and a general
disease is suddenly produced from
a local sore, as, for instance, in small-pox,
there is no diffusion of matter, nor
is it ever conveyed beyond the lymphatic
glands.</p>

<p>In this particular complaint, the consequence
of sympathetic action, or the
propagation of action, is sometimes the
induction of the same disease in other
parts; but most commonly the effect is
the establishment of the hectic, or diseased
formative action; for an explanation
of which I refer to the dissertation
on simple inflammation.</p>

<p>By examination, we find, that, in
many instances, cancer is evidently produced<span class="pagenum" title="450"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a></span>
by the same causes which are capable
of producing simple inflammation;
and, in every instance, I apprehend, that
although the causes may be obscure, yet
they are exactly of the same nature. It
is, however, a general opinion, that this
disease arises frequently from some unknown
and mysterious cause which we
cannot detect, and which, therefore, has
been resolved into some constitutional
taint, or cancerous ferment. But, so far
as we know, the constitution is perfectly
healthy in the commencement of
this disease; nor is there the smallest
of that it resembles scrophula, in depending
upon any peculiarity of constitution,
before the causes operate.</p>

<p>Blows, bruises, and other exciting
causes of inflammation, are apt to produce
cancer; but, in many instances,
we can detect no evident local cause<span class="pagenum" title="451"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a></span>
acting directly on the part. In the
breast, for instance, we frequently perceive
cancer commence without the interference
of any topical agent. In these
cases, however, we may uniformly detect
an irregularity or disappearance of
the menstrual secretion. It was formerly
observed, that the uterus and mammæ
exhibited very powerfully the sympathy
of equilibrium; and it is upon this doctrine,
which it is unnecessary farther to
illustrate, that we are to explain the affection
of the breast, which so frequently
takes place in consequence of the cessation
of the menses; for when the active
state of the uterus is lost, the action
of the mammæ is preternaturally increased,
and a species of slow inflammation
is induced. It is upon this principle
only that we can explain why cancers
are so frequent at the cessation of<span class="pagenum" title="452"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a></span>
the <span class="nowrap">menses<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span>. It is ridiculous to suppose
that this discharge acts as a drain to the
constitution, and carries off impurities,
which would otherwise collect elsewhere,
and produce local diseases. The breast is
almost the only organ which becomes thus
affected without any agent acting directly
upon the part alone; for, in most other
instances, we may detect the operation
of such causes at least as tend to induce
simple affections of the same part;
but, in both instances, the modus operandi<span class="pagenum" title="453"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a></span>
of the cause is alike, only circumstances
are somewhat varied.</p>

<p>When the inflammatory action is
slowly induced, whether by a bruise, or
any other cause, acting directly on the
part, or by sympathetic union with another
part, we find, that the tumor which
is consequent to this, seldom manifests a
disposition to remove quickly, or assume
the healing process. The part neither
performs any distinct and acute inflammatory
action, nor does it resume its natural
condition and appearance, but remains
in a new state, different from either,
which I will call the state of simple
<span class="nowrap">schirrus<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span>. If this state, which may follow
the application of the common exciting
causes of inflammation in any<span class="pagenum" title="454"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a></span>
part, take place in cellular substance, or
similar parts, which are possessed of no
glandular structure, then a chronic tumor
is produced, which is either slowly
diminished by absorption, or at last unable
to carry on its actions in perfection,
being, in some respect, insulated, and
deprived of the support of the surrounding
<span class="nowrap">parts<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span>; a diseased action, or morbid
performance of its actions, takes place; a
slow inflammatory condition is <span class="nowrap">produced<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span>,
and at last ulceration succeeds. This, in general,
forms pseudo-cancer, provided that
the constitution be simple, that is to say,
healthy: But if it take place in a scrophulous
habit, the tumor is apt to become<span class="pagenum" title="455"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a></span>
scrophulous, having its morbid actions
modified by the morbid condition of the
system. If this event take place in a
lymphatic gland, instead of the cellular
substance, then the tumor is still more
apt to become affected with scrophulous
inflammation, in consequence of even a
very trifling scrophulous modification of
the habit. If this state be produced in
a secretory gland, the affection is somewhat
different from that in simple parts,
or those which do not secrete; because
the inflammatory action becomes somewhat
modified by the natural secreting
action of the part; and, in this point of
view, the gland may be considered as
possessing a specific constitution, although
the general constitution be simple; for,
naturally possessing a peculiar mode of
action, it follows, that new actions induced
in such a part, ought to be performed
in a different manner from the<span class="pagenum" title="456"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a></span>
same actions in parts which naturally do
not possess this peculiarity, and that the
actions ought to be specifically different.
When these parts are attacked with acute
simple inflammation, it differs from
inflammation in the cellular substance in
certain circumstances, and particularly in
being much more tedious; but when the
nature of the part is still farther altered
by the accession of a slow inflammatory
action, which operates in the manner
above described, then it assumes a specific
inflammation, which ends in ulceration.
The exact, or specific nature, of
this, is various; and the state, which we
call cancerous, is probably only one of
the varieties of this morbid inflammatory
action; and whether the part shall
assume this variety, or some other variation,
as, for instance, pseudo-cancer, depends
probably upon local circumstances,
which we cannot as yet detect or explain.<span class="pagenum" title="457"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a></span>
If, however, the constitution possess any
specific mode of action, the tumor generally
assumes nearly the same mode; and,
therefore, in scrophulous people, these
tumors more frequently become affected
with scrophulous inflammation, than
with cancer: At the same time, if the
previous change on the gland, induced
by the slow inflammatory condition,
have been great, the scrophulous condition,
which it possesses in common with
the rest of the system, becomes modified
in it, in the same way as the simple
condition, in healthy habits, is modified
by the new or schirrous state of the
gland; and, therefore, the scrophulous
inflammation is sometimes different, and
the ulceration more fungous than in
other parts.</p>

<p>The causes, then, of simple inflammation,
when they operate slowly, or leave<span class="pagenum" title="458"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a></span>
the part in a state neither inflamed nor
healthy, give rise to a chronic enlargement,
and change of nature, which I
have called simple <span class="nowrap">schirrus<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span>. This performs,
like every other part, certain actions,
which are intended for its own
support, and which must make a part of
the general action of the system, or be in
unison with the rest of the body. But
as its actions are different in nature from
those which any part of the body naturally<span class="pagenum" title="459"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a></span>
ought to perform, and as originally
this organ, (which, from the changes induced
on it, is to be considered as new
and extraneous), formed no part of the human
frame, there is not that connection
betwixt it and the rest of the system,
which is necessary for its support. It,
therefore, does not derive the same aid
and support from the neighbouring parts
which natural organs do, (for no part,
or individual organ, can exist and support
itself singly, and independent of the
rest), and, accordingly, must soon come
to suffer. It is unable to perform its necessary
actions in perfection; they become
morbid, and of an inflammatory
nature. The tumor is now an inflamed
schirrus; and this inflammation either
assumes a modification, from the specific
nature of the constitution, or from the
peculiar nature of the tumor itself,
which, as has been explained, is different<span class="pagenum" title="460"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a></span>
from the healthy state of the tumid part.
We have, therefore, the scrophulous, the
cancerous, the pseudo-cancerous inflamed
schirrus; and the symptoms of these
different kinds of schirri, and the appearance
of the ulceration, will, cæteris paribus,
be modified by the nature of the
part affected. The same disease, therefore,
exhibits slight variations in different
organs, as has been described in the
history of cancer, and might, therefore,
were we inclined to multiply distinctions,
be considered as so many different
diseases.</p>

<p>This disease is most apt to take place
in elderly people, (in so much that some
consider it as peculiar to old age); because
in them, parts sustain injury of
their actions worst, or are less able to recover
from them. Hence, two consequences
follow: First, Simple schirrus is<span class="pagenum" title="461"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461"></a></span>
more easily produced, resolution of inflammation
being more difficult, especially
in parts which are, at all times, rather
tedious in their recovery, when inflamed:
Second, The simple schirrus is
more apt to inflame, or have, what may be
called, <i>its</i> necessary actions impeded and
deranged. It must, however, be remembered,
that there is no age whatever exempted
from this disease: I have seen it
distinctly marked, and attended with a
fatal event, in children of five years
<span class="nowrap">old<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is a controverted point, how far it
is possible to produce cancer by inocula<span class="pagenum" title="462"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a></span>tion;
some maintaining, that the application
of cancerous matter to a sound
part will induce the disease; others,
that it is altogether harmless. Analogical
evidence is certainly in favour of the
first opinion; because the majority of
specific ulcers may be inoculated, and
have been so by accident. But, at the
same time, it must be admitted, that
there are few well established cases of
this particular point. We find, however,
that, like the venereal matter, the cancerous,
when absorbed, induces a disease in
the lymphatic glands, of a cancerous nature.
We would, therefore, be led to
conclude, that if the matter be capable
of inducing cancer by absorption, in a
distant part, it ought likewise to be capable
of producing the same disease in
another person by inoculation. The
same be said of the spongoid inflammation,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="463"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a></span></p>

<p>From these observations, it will, I
presume, appear, first, That when a part
is incapable of performing the actions
necessary for its preservation in a state
of health, it generally slowly assumes the
inflammatory state, which goes on to ulceration;
but the part being unable to
support its natural action, can much less
perform the actions necessary for restoration
from this morbid condition, which,
therefore, continues permanently and
progressively increasing; that the nature
of this unhealthy action is not always
the same, but admits of variations dependent
upon certain conditions in the
previous state of the part affected, with
regard to which we are greatly in the
dark. Cancer, pseudo-cancer, spongoid
inflammation, &amp;c. are some of these variations.</p>

<p>Secondly, Cancer, and all these va<span class="pagenum" title="464"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a></span>riations,
are originally, in the strictest
sense of the word, local diseases, depending
neither upon any constitutional affection,
nor the presence of any general
cause. They do, however, in progress
of time, affect not only parts in their vicinity,
but also the system in general,
producing, by means of sympathetic actions,
specific hectic affections, as has
been formerly explained, when treating
of simple hectic. They likewise spread
over more surface in the part at first affected,
and produce the same morbid actions
without variation, by means of the
sympathia consociationis serpens. They
also induce a similar disease in the nearest
lymphatic glands, by absorption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="465"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a></span></p>


<h3><i>Of the Prevention and Treatment of Cancer.</i></h3>

<p>From what has been said, it will appear,
that cancer is to be prevented by
using the most vigorous means for the
removal of simple schirri, upon their first
appearance. Of these, local bleeding is
the most powerful, and ought to be freely
employed. Next to this, an issue in
the neighbourhood of the part ought to
be most depended on; and these two remedies
must be employed early, and continued
carefully. Whenever a simple
schirrus arises, we ought to be on our
guard, in whatever situation it may be
placed; but, if it occupy a secretory
gland, we require to be doubly vigilant.
This, at first, is not painful, at least the
patient only complains of slight uneasiness<span class="pagenum" title="466"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"></a></span>
shooting for a moment through it.
This circumstance too frequently prevents
the patient from attending to it;
for where there is no inconvenience sustained,
there is little inducement to apply
for assistance; and, not unfrequently, an
ill-judged modesty contributes to this delay.
But, although the patient may be
little concerned at this period, yet the
surgeon must not observe the same indolence.
Aware of the dangerous consequences
of allowing the tumor to follow
its natural course, he will apply leeches
once and again, and insert an issue as
near the part as possible. The remedies
called discutient have been much recommended
at this stage; such as sal ammoniac
dissolved in vinegar; and this is
sometimes useful, but perhaps not more
so than the vegetable acid by itself:
When it does not interfere with bleeding,
it may be usefully employed. By<span class="pagenum" title="467"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467"></a></span>
means of these remedies, we may frequently
remove recent tumors, which depend
merely upon the enlargement of an
organ, without any other considerable
change of structure. But it is more difficult
to remove tumors which are not
produced by the mere enlargement of a
part, but depend upon a change of structure,
or the formation of new parts; as,
for instance, warts, polypi, &amp;c. The small
indolent tumors, however, which take
place in the cellular substance, may sometimes
be removed by the early use of
these remedies.</p>

<p>When these means have either been
neglected, or fail when employed, and
the schirrus begins to inflame, there is
little hope of performing a cure by either
local or general applications; and extirpation
affords the only chance of recovery
which can be depended on. But,<span class="pagenum" title="468"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a></span>
as it is not always at the very first
certain that the schirrus has assumed
the cancerous inflammation, and is not
curable, the operation ought not to be
advised in the first instance, or upon the
very first appearance of the pain, or
symptoms of commencing inflammation;
on the contrary, we ought to have recourse
to local bleeding, the use of issues,
mild diet, and perhaps the use of cicuta;
but if these remedies do not evidently
arrest the progress of the disease, diminish
the pain very considerably, and
make the tumor perceptibly softer and less,
in the course of a few weeks, we ought,
without hesitation, to advise the removal
of the part, which I shall presently consider.</p>

<p>The local bleeding is to be performed
with leeches, which are preferable to the
scarificator, being attended with less ir<span class="pagenum" title="469"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a></span>ritation.
Three leeches may be applied
to the part every second day, as has been
proposed by some writers on this disease.
This practice must be continued for a
considerable time; and, during the intervals
of bleeding, cloths dipped in cold
water ought to be applied. If, in the
course of a month, the tumor becomes
freer from pain, and softer, we may apply
the leeches only every third day, and
continue this for another month, and afterwards
either persist for some time
longer in the same way, or repeat the
application at longer intervals, according
to circumstances. But if, on the contrary,
the tumor become rather larger,
and more painful, as sometimes happens,
when the disease is farther advanced before
we begin, and if the constitution suffer
by the repeated evacuations, we must
desist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="470"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470"></a></span></p>

<p>Issues may be formed, either by introducing
a small seton superficially on
each side of the tumor, or by blistering
the part, and afterwards keeping it open
with savine ointment. The latter of these
methods is not admissible, when the disease
has proceeded so far as to make the
skin adhere to the gland, and become
puckered; indeed, at this period, issues
formed in any way ought never to be
advised, unless the operation will not be
consented to; because the chance of their
producing a cure is very little, and we
lose time by trusting to them.</p>

<p>Mild and spare diet has a very considerable
influence over this disease, in
almost every period, and contributes
greatly to retard its progress. It ought
therefore rigidly to be conjoined with
the bleeding and issues, in the commencement
of the disease, and will tend to<span class="pagenum" title="471"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471"></a></span>
abate the action in the part, and promote
its resolution. The diet ought to consist
of stewed apples, or prunes, panada, and
weak broths, with bread. It has even been
proposed to prohibit almost entirely the
use of solid food, and to allow the patient
nothing but water for the course of several
weeks. This was much recommended
by M. Pouteau, who was led to make
trial of it by the success attending the
empirical practice of an ecclesiastic. It
was afterwards enforced by Callison; and
more lately abstinence has been favourably
mentioned by Mr. Pearson, who relates
some cases of cancer, or appearance
of cancer, in the uterus, in which it produced
very astonishing effects, abating
the pain, diminishing the swelling, and
re-establishing the general health.</p>

<p>By means of these remedies, we may
sometimes succeed in removing by degrees<span class="pagenum" title="472"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"></a></span>
a schirrus, after it has evidently begun
to inflame, and threatens to become
cancerous. But if, notwithstanding these
remedies, the disease evidently continues
to increase, or if, in the course of a few
weeks, they do not produce an evident
effect, we cannot with propriety delay the
operation, which is the most certain method
of cure, and one which succeeds in
a majority of instances, if early and properly
performed; nor ought any other
method of treatment to be proposed in
opposition to it, unless in the very commencement
of the inflammatory state;
and it is in this period only that I propose
the above treatment, unless the patient
absolutely decline the operation; for
when the skin becomes puckered, and the
inflammation has continued clearly for a
considerable time, without any measures
being taken to remove it, the success of
any local or general remedy is exceedingly<span class="pagenum" title="473"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a></span>
precarious, and delay is not only useless,
but frequently dangerous. It has,
however, been doubted by some very ingenious
surgeons, whether it was proper
to advise the operation at any period, they
believing, from the number of relapses,
that it was almost useless; whilst others
have been against the early performance
of it, on the principle, that some parts
already diseased might not have, at this
period, become evidently affected; and,
therefore, might inadvertently be allowed
to remain.</p>

<p>The late Dr. <span class="nowrap">Monro<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span>, from observing,
that almost all the patients on whom,
to his knowledge, the operation had been
performed, relapsed, is inclined rather to
adopt the palliative treatment, than the<span class="pagenum" title="474"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474"></a></span>
extirpation. He takes for granted, that,
in the generality of cases, cancer depends
upon some internal cause. In these cases,
he is decidedly averse from the operation,
and advises it only when the disease occurs
owing to blows or hurts in young and
healthy people. But, in considering this opinion,
we are to remember, that a great
many of these cases may be supposed to
have been very far advanced before any operation
was performed; and likewise, that
the method of operating, in that period,
was extremely unfavourable to a cure,
the wound being kept open, and suppurations
and ulceration rather encouraged
than avoided. More lately, Mr. Hill of
Dumfries has published an account of
cases, where the operation was performed
in more favourable circumstances, and
of these not a seventh part suffered a relapse.
The present Dr. Monro gives even
a more favourable account; for, if I am<span class="pagenum" title="475"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"></a></span>
not much mistaken, he observes, in his
lectures, that not one-third of the cases
in which he had been consulted, had relapsed.
From my own observations, I
cannot judge very accurately; because
many of those on whom I have operated,
came from parts at a great distance, and
with which I had no intercourse; consequently,
I could not hear of the result
of those cases: But of the cases, the
sequel of which I have heard, not a fifth
part have relapsed; and in those the operation
was performed at a period when
the axillary glands had become diseased,
but were not evidently so; and, therefore,
were not extirpated; for, in all of
them, the disease reappeared in the lymphatic
glands. But, even from this relapse,
the patients may be cured by a second
operation. We may, therefore,
conclude, that, if the operation be early
performed, the majority will recover;<span class="pagenum" title="476"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a></span>
and even although the disease should afterwards
appear in the lymphatic glands,
the patient is not incurable; for we frequently
succeed in extirpating cancers,
when the glands are very much affected
before we are applied to. I have operated
in cases where I was obliged to dissect
the glands, from the axillary artery
alongst almost all its course in the armpit,
and which reached well nigh to the
articulation.</p>

<p>With regard to the argument against
the early extirpation, founded upon the
possibility of the disease having affected
parts in the vicinity, which have not
yet evidently become <span class="nowrap">diseased<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span>, I may
observe, that, upon the same principle,
we ought not to operate until the axillary<span class="pagenum" title="477"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a></span>
glands swell; because they may be
affected, although they be not yet evidently
enlarged; and, therefore, may give
rise to a relapse. If we only remove the
single gland in the breast, which is hard,
we doubtless run a great hazard of a relapse;
but, I apprehend, that this ought
never to be done, and that the whole of
the glandular part of the breast ought to
be removed at once; because we thus more
certainly prevent a return of the disease,
which we cannot otherwise, with any certainty,
do. The additional pain is very inconsiderable;
and we can derive very little
advantage or benefit from leaving a part
of the mamma behind.</p>

<p>The caustic has been proposed, instead
of the knife, for the removal of cancer
schirrus; but it is much less certain,
more tedious, and even more painful.
Instead, therefore, of recommending itself<span class="pagenum" title="478"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a></span>
to timorous patients, this practice is
still more to be dreaded than the excision,
which is more terrible in anticipation,
than in the actual performance of
it.</p>

<p>The caustic most commonly, and indeed
almost universally, employed, is arsenic,
mixed with various inert substances,
and formed into a paste or <span class="nowrap">ointment<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span>.
This has been applied in two ways; first,
directly upon the skin, covering the schirrus,
and then, after this is destroyed, upon
the schirrus itself, destroying it layer by
layer; second, directly upon the skin,
and then, instead of applying it to the
gland, to put it round it on the surrounding<span class="pagenum" title="479"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479"></a></span>
cellular substance, and by gradually
destroying this round the gland, to turn
out the schirrus entire. This was the
practice of Mr. Guy, who gained considerable
credit by his success; and, since
his time, it has occasionally been performed
with success by some <span class="nowrap">others<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span>.</p>

<p>This method, however, is liable to
several material objections: It is uncertain
in its issue; for, if the gland be not
completely removed, the disease makes a
rapid progress afterwards. It frequently
happens, that some smaller glands around
the large one are affected; and<span class="pagenum" title="480"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"></a></span>
these are greatly irritated by the action
of the caustic in their vicinity: It is
more painful than the operation with the
knife; and the subsequent process of
healing, even granting the method to
succeed in removing the diseased part, is
much more tedious than when the incision
is employed, and union by the first intention
procured.</p>

<p>On all these accounts, but most especially
on account of its uncertainty, the
method of cure by caustic can never be
sanctioned by any modern surgeon,
much less can it ever be held up in opposition
to extirpation by the knife.</p>

<p>This practice, which has had many
advocates for its employment in schirrus,
has been equally recommended in cases
of cancerous ulcers; but here it is still
less admissible; for the extent of diseased<span class="pagenum" title="481"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a></span>
parts is generally greater; the neighbouring
parts are affected to a greater
distance; indurated and diseased lymphatics
frequently extend from the breast
to glands in the axilla. It is, therefore,
next to impossible to turn out the morbid
parts, as “nuclei,” by destroying
the substance around them; and it is equally
improbable that we shall, unless
the sore be very small, and the caustic
very strong, be able to make it slough
off in successive layers. Farther we can
propose no advantage to ourselves, from
employing caustic in preference to the
scalpel; because in every instance in
which we can destroy the parts by
means of this, we can equally safely, infinitely
more speedily, and with much
less pain, remove the parts with the
knife. There is only one case in which
caustic is useful, and that is merely as
an appendage to the operation of excision.<span class="pagenum" title="482"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a></span>
When we dissect off ulcers from parts
where, owing to the want of cellular
substance, the skin is not lax enough
to be brought over the parts, or when
so much of this has been removed,
that, although lax, it cannot be made to
cover it, we may find it of service to rub
the bottom of the wound with lunar
caustic, as we thus stop the oozing of
blood, and destroy any little portions of
the diseased part which we may have
left.</p>

<p>For the purpose of destroying cancerous
ulcers, many caustics and escharotics
have been proposed, such as the arsenic,
corrosive sublimate, lunar caustic, &amp;c.
Of these no one seems to possess a preference
over the rest, if we consider only
their local action; but some of them, especially
arsenic, are apt to produce bad<span class="pagenum" title="483"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483"></a></span>
effects, and that very unexpectedly, on
the constitution.</p>

<p>After making these remarks upon
the method of cure, I shall conclude
with some observations on different remedies,
which have been proposed as
palliatives, where the operation is not
admirable, or will not be consented to,
and which have even been supposed capable
of changing the mode of acting
altogether, and producing of themselves
a cure. These remedies I shall divide into
general and topical.</p>

<p>Of the general remedies, those which
have been most frequently, and with the
greatest confidence, employed, are narcotics,
such as the cicuta, opium, nightshade,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The cicuta is a medicine which was,<span class="pagenum" title="484"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a></span>
at one time, in very high repute, and
owed its reputation to the experimenting
talent of Storck, who has written several
libelli on this plant. According to him,
cicuta possesses very evident powers over
cancer, and has cured a great many
cases; but, in less prejudised hands, it
has been much less successful; and even
in many of the instances adduced by Baron
Storck of its utility, it is by no
means proved, that the disease was really
cancer. The present opinion of the
public seems to be very unfavourable
with regard to this medicine; and from
the numerous instances in which it has
failed, this opinion seems to be very just.
Alongst with the proper local applications
which have been formerly noticed,
it sometimes is of service in removing
simple <span class="nowrap">schirri<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span>; but I have never<span class="pagenum" title="485"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a></span>
found it of any service when the schirrus
had affirmed the cancerous inflammation,
much less when it has proceeded
the length of ulceration. In the last
case, I have never found it even produce
the temporary melioration which
many talk of.</p>

<p>The common way of exhibiting the
hemlock, is to begin with small doses,
and increase these gradually, until they
produce vertigo: For this purpose, we
may begin with two grains of the extract,
or four of the powder, recently prepared,
twice or thrice a-day, and gradually
increase the <span class="nowrap">quantity<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span>. In this way,<span class="pagenum" title="486"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a></span>
we find that some patients have come to
take an ounce of the extract daily; but
if a much less quantity than this produce
no good effect, we may consider it
as useless to continue a remedy, which,
in this dose, must injure the constitution
every day that it is continued. On the
continent, the hemlock has been used in
the form of a bath; but it is so disagreeable,
that few can be brought to
use it.</p>

<p>The belladona has been much recommended
by Lambergen, who tried it in
many cases of cancer; but these trials, when
repeated with attention, have not been
greatly in favour of the remedy. During
its use, he kept the bowels open with<span class="pagenum" title="487"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487"></a></span>
clysters, administered every second day.
The dose, at first, ought to be a grain of
the dried leaves, made into a pill. This,
in the beginning, is to be given morning
and evening, and afterwards more frequently.</p>

<p>The hyocyamus has also been frequently
used in cancer, and was very
much in repute with the ancients. I
have tried it occasionally, but with very
little effect. The dose with which we
begin, is two grains of the extract.</p>

<p>The aconitum is a more powerful and
dangerous narcotic, in so much that a
quarter of a grain of the extract is generally
the dose with which we begin.</p>

<p>The solanum dulcamara, Paris quadrifolia,
phytolacca, &amp;c. have been likewise
recommended and employed, but<span class="pagenum" title="488"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488"></a></span>
are now so little used, that it is unnecessary
to take any notice of them
<span class="nowrap">here<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span>.</p>

<p>The laurus cerasus is a very powerful
narcotic, and has been used, in this
particular complaint, by Richter, but
with very little success. The most common
preparation of this medicine, is the
distilled water; but the dose of this is
very uncertain. Some have, therefore,
proposed to give, for a dose, four or five
grains of the fresh leaves infused in a
little water.</p>

<p>The digitalis has a considerable power
of abating vascular action, and may,
therefore, be of use, in the same point of
view with abstinence, bleeding, &amp;c. in<span class="pagenum" title="489"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489"></a></span>
abating the action of schirri; but concerning
its real utility in this disease, I
cannot say any thing with certainty.</p>

<p>Opium is seldom employed with an
intention of curing this disease, although
it is probable, that it possesses just as
much power over cancer, as those other
narcotics which have been more frequently
used. It is, however, liberally
employed with a view to abating the
pain of cancerous ulcers.</p>

<p>Tonic remedies have frequently been
used in this disease; but although they
may sometimes improve the general
health, yet they never produce any effect
upon the local disease. On this account,
they are now very seldom employed.</p>

<p>Arsenic is a medicine, which has, by<span class="pagenum" title="490"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490"></a></span>
some, been considered as a specific against
<span class="nowrap">cancer<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span>; but even those who
maintain this, add, that although they <i>believe</i>
and <i>think</i> so, yet they have not been
able to administer it in such quantities
as to produce any good effect.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Mercury<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span> has also been recommended;
but there is no fact more certainly
ascertained than this, that mercury uniformly
exasperates this disease, especially
when it has proceeded the length of ulceration.
In this case, the sores enlarge
rapidly, become much more painful, and
bleed frequently. It is worthy of observation,
that those who are affected with
cancer, have in general the mercurial action<span class="pagenum" title="491"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491"></a></span>
induced very easily and very <span class="nowrap">speedily<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span>;
and the changes which take place
on the ulcer are equally rapid. This circumstance,
of mercury increasing the
disease, in so marked a manner as it usually
does, ought not only to make surgeons
careful of exhibiting this remedy,
upon slight suspicions of the sore being
<span class="nowrap">venereal<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span>, but may likewise be attended
to as a step toward the discovery of a
better mode of treatment for cancer than
we yet possess; because if, at any time,
we discover the means of directly displacing
and counteracting the mercurial action,
we may perhaps find the same to be
useful in abating the cancerous; these two
actions appearing to possess some general<span class="pagenum" title="492"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a></span>
coincidence, from their mutual effect in
increasing each other.</p>

<p>Copper, in the form of cuprum vitriolatum,
has been used in cancer; and
one case is recorded, in which it is
said to have produced a cure; but in
every other case it has failed; and, from
the violent effects which it is apt to produce,
considerable danger attends its exhibition.</p>

<p>Muriated barytes has been proposed
as a cure for this disease; but now none
employ it with this expectation.</p>

<p>The same remedies which internally
have been supposed to cure cancer, have
also been proposed as local applications.</p>

<p>Amongst the older practitioners, narcotics
were very currently employed as a<span class="pagenum" title="493"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493"></a></span>
dressing for cancerous sores. Vesalius
used cloths dipped in the juice of the solanum;
whilst others employed it mixed
with oil of roses, and preparations of lead
and antimony. Others had recourse to
the hyocyamus; whilst of late the cicuta
poultices seem to have superseded the use
of most other narcotic preparations.
These have, undoubtedly, in many cases,
abated the pain, and diminished the fœtor;
but this is all which can reasonably
be expected from them; and even
this expectation will not always be realised.</p>

<p>Carrot poultices are still more useful,
as they possess the property of abating
the fœtor, in a degree superior to
the hemlock, and give generally as much
ease. This fœtor has been long compared
to the smell of hepar sulphuris,
and lately has been supposed to arise altogether<span class="pagenum" title="494"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a></span>
from the formation of a substance
of this nature, consisting of sulphur
and volatile alkali. As it has been
too much the case in medicine, to overlook
causes, and attend to effects, so we are
not to be surprised, if we find some physicians
proposing to cure cancer, by remedies
which shall decompose the matter
which is yielded in that disease, or destroy
the effect of the morbid action,
whilst the action itself is <span class="nowrap">overlooked<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span>.
From experiments made upon the hepatized
ammonia, it was found, that the
oxygenated muriatic acid was the best agent
for decomposing it, and destroying
its smell. This fluid was, therefore,<span class="pagenum" title="495"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a></span>
highly recommended as an application
for cancerous sores; and, in many instances,
it will indeed be found to correct
the fœtor, which is certainly one
advantage; but it never will perform a
cure.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid has been said not only
to correct the fœtor, but also, in some
instances, completely to cure the disease.
It was long ago proposed by M. Peyrilhe,
and of late it has again been brought forward
by Dr. Ewart, who has published a
case in which it produced cicatrization;
but although, upon his recommendation, it
has been frequently employed, yet it has
very seldom been of any considerable
service, and I have heard of no instance
in which it produced any permanent amendment.
It would rather appear, that
the opinion of M. de Fourcroy was the
just one: “After the first applications<span class="pagenum" title="496"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a></span>
(says he), the cancerous sore appears to
assume a more favourable aspect, the
sanies which flowed from it becomes
whiter, thicker, and purer, and the
flesh has a redder and fresher colour;
but these flattering appearances are
deceitful, nor do they continue long,
for the sore speedily returns to its former
state, and its progress goes on as
before the application.” The best method
of applying this, is by means of a
bladder, the mouth of which is fastened
round the sore, by means of adhesive
plaster. The air is introduced by a pipe
inserted at the other end. When first
applied, the gas produces a sensation of
coldness, which is soon followed by a
glowing heat, and abatement of the peculiar
pain of the sore. At other times,
it, from the first, produces a smarting,
and makes the patient rather more uneasy.
This is especially the case if we<span class="pagenum" title="497"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a></span>
use the fermenting poultice, instead of the
air already extricated.</p>

<p>Digitalis, applied either in poultices
or infusion, has been said to abate the
pain, and meliorate the appearance of the
sore; but, in this respect, it seems to be
very much on a level with cicuta.</p>

<p>Tar ointment, gastric juice, absorbent
powders, and many other applications,
which it is unnecessary to enumerate,
have been proposed; but as their utility
is by no means evinced, I shall not detain
the reader with any remarks upon
them.</p>

<p>Caustic, and escharotic preparations,
have been already considered.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, when the ulcer does
not admit of being extirpated, all which<span class="pagenum" title="498"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a></span>
can be done, is to keep the sore clean,
by washing it carefully, and dressing it
with some mild ointment, or using some
of the poultices or lotions already mentioned,
if these do not gall the skin, at
the same time that we keep the patient
easy by administering opium.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Having now concluded these observations
on the cancerous inflammation,
I should next proceed to the consideration
of the venereal inflammation; but
the dissertations on this subject must be
reserved for another volume.</p>

Bringing two surfaces in contact, although they naturally
were not so, will have the same effect. Thus, if
the skin be taken off the edges of our fingers, and the side
of the one be applied to the side of the other, adhesion will
take place, and no inflammation will be produced. When
a part is inflamed, and one portion is brought in contact
with another, we uniformly find, that the inflammation is
less where the parts were in contact than elsewhere. Thus,
when the intestines are inflamed, the parts suffer least which
touch other intestines, whilst the angle betwixt the folds
is most affected. This fact is observed by Mr. Hunter,
but explained upon the principle of contiguous sympathy;
or, “a mutual harmony being produced, which prevents
their being inflamed.”</p></div>

Opiates may indeed abate the smarting, or soreness,
which is consequent to the immediate mechanical injury of
wounds, or operations; but this relief is commonly only
temporary; for the general action is very apt to be afterwards
increased, and, consequently, union by adhesion is
less likely to take place.</p></div>

There are two general diseases which are connected
with local actions, and which opium is supposed to cure, or
prevent from taking place; the inflammatory fever, dependent
on an wound, and the febrile state, consequent to
a temporary increased action, or exertion of a particular
part, or the whole of the system; as, for instance, the effect
of parturition. The first of these is always aggravated by
opium; the second, if it be not increased, cannot possibly
be cured by it.</p></div>

By peculiar action, I do not here mean what is commonly
understood by the term specific, but the action
which is proper to the artery, considered as an individual,
in opposition to the action of the heart and arteries, considered
in general as an entire circulating system; for one part
of this system may act less powerfully than another, and
may be more dilated, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">16</a>
The distance to which this will extend, depends
chiefly upon the quantity of blood which is lost, and the
size of the vessel which is affected.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">17</a>
This depends upon the operation of the sympathy of
association. Sympathy was, in the preliminary dissertation,
divided into that of association, and that of equilibrium;
and it was mentioned, that the same parts might
be made to exhibit either of these, but that naturally the
sympathy of association is chiefly, and most easily exhibited
by those parts which are similar in structure, and
contiguous to each other; and, in them, the action spreads
fastest. At the same time, if the action continues long, or
be very strong, it may be propagated to dissimilar parts,
and produce either a very extensive, or an universal action,
which is just a greater degree of the sympathy of association.
In this case, it has, however, been called universal
sympathy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">18</a>
The solution must, upon the principles already laid
down, be both weak, and only so cold as to reduce the
sensation of the part to its natural condition, that is to say,
so as to abate the morbid feeling of heat; because, if we
make it otherwise, we may injure the powers of recovery,
and perhaps induce gangrene. The application ought not
to be so cold as to excite the sensation of coldness, at least
in any considerable degree.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">19</a>
Bark is useful and necessary in every case of erysipelas,
after the inflammatio valida has abated. Local applications,
of a stimulating nature, are also useful at this period,
as will afterwards be mentioned, when the inflammatio
debilis comes to be considered.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">20</a>
From what has been said in the preliminary dissertation,
we may understand how moisture should tend to induce
a secretion. Agents frequently excite conditions
somewhat similar to their general properties: Thus, putrid
matter tends to induce the action of descent, and
consequent putrefaction. We likewise experimentally find,
that, if moisture be applied during a general increased action,
it induces perspiration, unless it be conjoined with
cold, which lessens the action.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">21</a>
The proper way to use electricity, in this case, is to
draw scintillæ from the part, the patient being insulated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">22</a>
Fomentations are made, by applying a soft cloth,
dipped in any warm fluid, (commonly water) to the part.
Sometimes the cloth is wrung hard, in which case it is
chiefly steam which is applied.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">23</a>
Poultices may also be made, by boiling pounded linseed-cake,
or from potatoes, or mashed vegetable leaves
(which are the cheapest for hospitals), such as tussilago, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">24</a>
The inflammatory action, when moderately strong,
acts naturally as an exciting cause, inducing the purulent
action, which is therefore said to be a termination of inflammation.
It is therefore as unnecessary to interfere in
the production of this secretion, when the action is of proper
strength, &amp;c. as it would be to attempt to increase, by
local means, the vesication which is produced by a blister.
Poultices are, in this condition, perhaps chiefly useful, by
removing the causes which tend to abate the action at an
improper time, such as those which produce resolution, as
cold, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">25</a>
They keep up the heat of the part, and keep it moist
until this happens, and prevent the action from flagging
suddenly, which is all that is required of them, when the
action is going on of itself in a proper degree.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">26</a>
When two parts are affected at the same time, in consequence
of an agent operating quickly on one of them,
they commonly exhibit the sympathy of association, which
takes place suddenly, but generally at first lasts only for a
short time, if the parts be distant; but, if the original disease
still continue, it may spread, inch by inch, until it
arrives at the part which was formerly affected, and which
is again affected more permanently, by the same kind of
sympathy taking place, but in a different way. In the
first case, we have the sympathia consociationis interrupta;
in the second, the sympathia consociationis serpens.
It is this last which is the cause of the extension of all action
in a part, and which, when strongly excited, overcomes
the natural tendency to the exhibition of the sympathy of
equilibrium. It is, however, more difficult for local action
to spread by degrees to parts which evince the sympathy of
equilibrium than other parts; and these, in general, are
longer of being affected. Thus, when inflammation begins
in the skin, it can much more easily spread along the skin
than dip down to the muscles.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">27</a>
In proportion as the action extends outward, it also
becomes more concentrated. An abscess is therefore somewhat
conical, or at least hemispherical, the base being turned
inward, and the apex outward. When the action reaches
the surface, it is first at a single point; but, by degrees, it
becomes extended, and the apex becomes broader.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">28</a>
Such as the thorax, trachea, &amp;c. Instances have
happened of suffocation being thus produced.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">29</a>
Although, in general, an abscess has little tendency
to extend itself deep down, but rather moves toward the
surface, although so far from it originally, that, had the
action extended equally in all other directions, the size of
the abscess must have been immense; yet, when it is situated
over a cavity, it may proceed toward that as if to an external
surface. Even, however, in this case, the general law,
of all actions tending to the skin, obtains; for the progress
outward is much quicker than that inward; but, if the action
commenced near the surface of the cavity, as is commonly
the case, the difference of the distance will compensate
for the superior tendency to extend outward; and,
therefore, the abscess may burst at the internal surface into
the cavity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">30</a>
In abscesses seated on the thorax, I have known the
intercostal muscles and pleura continue the suppurative action,
after the external surface had opened, and thus an
opening came to be formed into the thorax.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">31</a>
This likewise affects the system, and produces syncope,
if the mechanical support be withdrawn suddenly from the
parts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">32</a>
This poultice does not require to be so hot, nor
changed so frequently, as before the full formation of matter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">33</a>
If this produces pain, we may in general conclude
that it has been used too soon.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">34</a>
This is exactly similar to an encysted tumor which
has been opened, and requires the same treatment. The
internal surface becomes thick and somewhat hard, like
that of a cyst. It differs from an encysted tumor only in
its cause and origin.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">35</a>
If pressure be employed early, to a considerable degree,
the irritation of the means employed produces pain,
and a morbid increase of action, unless we keep down the
action by cold, as will be explained when considering the
treatment of ulcers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">36</a>
When a bone becomes carious, the periosteum is completely
detached, and, therefore, it is felt to be rough by
the probe. Its colour becomes first of a dull white, or
dirty yellow, which it either preserves, or changes for the
intermediate hues betwixt these and black. It is generally
more porous than formerly, and lighter; but these qualities
vary, from very slight degrees, to the appearance of a
light coralline.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">37</a>
If we use the solution, we must, if the bone be very
porous, or spongy, apply only a little at once, otherwise it
may sink down, and injure a part which we do not wish to
act on.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">38</a>
There is a curious case of caries, which is frequently
met with: The diseased part, instead of being cast off, is
surrounded by a covering of new bone, (except at one portion,
where a sinus and ulcer is formed in the soft parts)
and may be felt rattling within it. In this case, there is
necessarily a permanent enlargement of the part, from the
additional bony matter; and this, together with the sinous
openings, and the internal caries, being felt with the probe,
form the character of the disease, which has been called
necrosis, a term which formerly implied merely mortification.
The cure of this complaint is to be accomplished by
extracting the diseased part, when it becomes loose, if the
opening in the case be sufficiently large; if not, it is to be
enlarged with the trephine, &amp;c. See the works of Ruysch,
Default, &amp;c.; and, more lately, the publication of Mr.
Russel.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">39</a>
These sinuses cannot be considered in this dissertation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">40</a>
This may sometimes be produced by the formation of
an abscess, without any evident cause; but at other times
it is produced by wounds, &amp;c. in scrophulous habits.</p></div>

Mr. Hunter supposes that these are useful, “because
they endeavour to keep up an universal harmony, by
putting the skin in good humour, which quiets every
sympathising part, and by counteracting the effects of
irritability.” P. 381.</p></div>

Exercise may be used either on foot, or on horseback,
or in a carriage; and its degree must be regulated by the
strength. There are few patients who cannot bear moderate
exercise (were it no more than walking half a minute
in a garden), and who will not be the better of this.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">43</a>

Sweating is perhaps to the general hectic action what
the suppuration is to the local one; and, therefore, can only
be stopped by influencing this action.</p></div>

When this disease attacks the lungs, as it too frequently
does, then, until a specific remedy for scrophula be
discovered, no cure can be obtained. Simple ulceration,
or suppuration of the lungs, however, and consequent hectic,
may be cured, though not in every instance.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">47</a>
Whenever the discharge does not separate completely
from the surface, when it is wiped, but part of it remains,
like a film, or jelly, betwixt the granulations, or on particular
spots, we may be sure that the action is not healthy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">48</a>
Simple ointment, rubbed up with a fourth part of its
weight of finely levigated calamine, or flowers of zinc,
makes a useful application. Mr. Bell recommends, amongst
other remedies, a saturnine ointment; but, if this produces
any specific operation, it must be a hurtful one, injuring the
action.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">49</a>
The circumstance of one part of an ulcer being more
affected than another, will be more fully noticed in considering
the next genus, in which it is of more practical
consequence. Ulcers generally belong to this species, before
they assume the characters of the second (for they frequently
change from one species, or genus, to another; in
which case, the treatment must also be changed).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">50</a>
The cause why these granulations rise, even this trifling
height, above the level of the skin, is the indolence of
the action, which prevents a cuticle from being formed in
due time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="label">51</a>
Indolence of the action does not imply that the quantity
of a discharge should be lessened, but only that its nature
should be changed. In this species, the discharge is
much the same in quantity as in a healthy ulcer of the same
size, but its perfection is greatly less.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="label">52</a>
Sometimes the granulating action and the cicatrizing
one seems to be confounded, the surface exhibiting a fibrous
fleshy appearance. This I have seen most frequently
in the calf of the leg; but it may occur in other parts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">53</a>
These ulcers, after long continuance, frequently induce
a disease in the bones or muscles seated below them, as will

The degree of pressure necessary for producing this
effect is proportioned to the susceptibility of the granulations,
or organic particles, for receiving the impression of
being in contact. When a part is healthy, the mere circumstance
of juxtaposition is sufficient for this purpose;
and, in a healthy ulcer, the weight of the body applied,
such as powdered chalk, or plaster of Paris, or at least the
gentle pressure of a stocking, or easy bandage, is all that
is necessary. But, when the action is too low, and the
granulations are consequently imperfect, both in their structure,
power of acting, and capability of receiving impressions,
the contact, in order to operate, must be nearer, and
more complete; or, in other words, the pressure must be
greater. In these cases, bandages not only act on the surface,
but also on the parts below, and, therefore, increase
the degree of contact of the newly-formed organic particles,
and thus strengthen the part.</p></div>

These acids coagulate the pus, and thus afford an artificial
covering, or film, which remains in close contact
with the granulations, and thus, by producing the natural
circumstance of contact and covering, the effects of which
have been already mentioned, as well as by creating a more
vigorous action by their specific action, they frequently bring
those sores into a healthy state.</p></div>

This operation is performed by making an incision
through the skin which covers the vena saphena below the
knee; a ligature is then passed under the vessel, by means
of a blunt needle, and the vessel is tied. In two or three
days the ligature may be removed, its circle being previously
divided with a pair of scissars.</p></div>

This affection of the ulcer, produced by a disease of
the parts below, is induced with a frequency nearly proportioned
to the aptitude of the part below for becoming diseased,
by the continuance of an ulcer over them. Tendons
and bones are particularly apt to be injured in this way;
and, therefore, ulcers seated over tendinous parts, or bones
thinly covered, are more apt to affect these, and to be reacted
on themselves, than when seated over fleshy parts.
On the same account, ulcers on the foot, or ankle joint,
are worse to heal than those a little farther up the leg; and
the difference is greater than can be explained wholly, by
the circumstance of distance from the heart, and possessing
less power of performing action properly. Recent ulcers
likewise heal easily on the feet, by proper treatment. It
is old ulcers alone which are difficult to manage, and the
cause is obvious.</p></div>

In the description of this variety, it was mentioned,
that there frequently was a small opening in the surface,
which communicated with the bone; but, even where this
is not the case, the layer of dead bone, when it exfoliates,
comes through the granulations; for the granulations of
the sound bone below raise it up, in consequence of which,
pressure is made from within outward upon the ulcer, by
which absorption is produced at that part, in a greater degree
than deposition; and, therefore, a vacuity is produced.</p></div>

As an illustration of this rule, I may mention the following
case: A man, during a voyage to a cold climate, had
both his feet frost-bit, in consequence of which mortification
ensued. In this state he continued for two or three
weeks, during which he received very little medical aid.
When I saw him, both his feet were mortified, from the
toes to about three inches above the ankle joints, his pulse
was feeble, very frequent, and intermittent, the strength
was greatly impaired, and the countenance sunk and ghastly.
The ulcerative action had been induced for some time,
but the want of wine and proper diet had prevented the
system from gaining by the cessation of the local disease.
He began the use of the bark, opium, wine, and soups,
which he took very liberally, in consequence of which his
pulse became slower, and his strength increased. In two
days, one of the ankle joints was removed by clipping
through the tendons, and, in a few days more, the other
came away. Amputation was now performed below the
knee of the right leg, the constitution, instead of gaining,
rather beginning to lose ground. The subsequent
affection of the system was by no means great, and, in
about a week, he was much stronger; but, as the bones
of the ankle joint of the other leg were carious, he again
began to sink. Amputation was therefore performed on
the left side, in about three weeks after the first. During
the cure, the wine, opium, and nourishing diet, were freely
prescribed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">74</a>
It is very seldom that a stump unites at first, if amputation
be performed on account of mortification; at least
if the operation be not delayed until the health and strength
be fully re-established: But this can very seldom be the
case; for, in most cases, the state of the bones, and the
disease of the part itself, prevents recovery from taking
place beyond a certain degree, and also prevents us from
delaying beyond a limited time. The system, therefore, is
not allowed to recover fully from the tendency to the action
of descent, and union does not take place. In the
case which was formerly mentioned, the first stump did not
adhere fully, but the second succeeded better, because then
the system suffered more from the state of the diseased
bones, &amp;c. than from the previous mortification, and, therefore,
it had not the same inability to undergo the healing
action.</p></div>

In most specific inflammations, if not in every one,

Some actions cannot be induced during the continuance
of others. Other actions can, in these circumstances,
be formed, and displace completely the former action. A
third set seem to give a modification to the original disease:
They change it to a certain degree; but the change is not
salutary, and they never displace it. The mercurial action,
when induced during the existence of some of the diseases
which I am describing, comes under the last, or third class.
At first, during the formation of the mercurial action, the
former diseased action is interrupted, in the same way as
the natural action is injured during the period of formation
of other actions, when no peculiar disease previously existed.
On this account, the sore assumes a better appearance; and,
if the action be nearly terminating naturally (as some actions
do, and as the primary action in these diseases more
readily does than the secondary), it quickly heals up; but,
if this be not the case, the appearances soon change, and
the disease becomes much worse.</p></div>

The morbid condition of the formative action is very
frequently manifested in the bones, which are less perfect,
that is to say, softer, containing less calcareous earth, and
later of being formed. Thus, the teeth are longer of appearing;
the bones of the head are soft and yielding, and
hence the head is large; the long bones bend and lose their
shape, or their extremities swell, and, from being more vascular
than their nature is fitted for, inflammation is very
apt to be induced. The yielding and increasing of the
bones of the cranium is likewise attended with a similar effect,
for the brain becomes too large in proportion to the
rest of the body, and is very apt to inflame, and have effusions
formed into it. At other times, the diseased state of
the formative action appears most distinctly at the surface,
the skin being rough, and very apt to desquamate.</p></div>

Parts which are improperly organised, or which are
not in every respect similar, both in their structure and constitution
(by which I mean, mode of acting in general), to
what naturally they ought to be, are not only less capable
of performing their actions aright, but likewise are to be
considered as in some respect extraneous to the human
body, or, as it were, insulated, and do not correspond exactly
to other parts. They therefore receive less support
from the neighbouring parts, and, consequently, have their
power diminished. The imperfection of action consequent
to these causes is proportioned to the morbid condition of
the part.</p></div>

It is to be regretted, that some who belong to our
profession, reason upon the nature of ulcers, not from appearances
and characteristic marks, but from the patients
manner of life, or the idea which they have formed of the
country whence they come. I remember two instances of
people who came from the Hebrides, the one with a cancer
of the lip, the other with a cancerous ulcer on the neck,
both fungous, and possessing the burning pain, and every
character of cancer; but as the sibbens unluckily prevailed
in that country, it was thought that the patients
might have received this infection, and accordingly were,
by a full consultation of surgeons, condemned to undergo
a course of mercury. The lip was, in three days, greatly
worse; the mercury was omitted, and the patient cured by
an operation. The sore on the neck was instantly exasperated,
and the patient, to use the words of Hildanus,
“had her soul speedily sent to heaven.”</p></div>

These are sometimes very irregular in their shape, and
have their sides very thin; so that, at first sight, they appear
like cavities formed by the separation of the fibres of
the part.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_114" href="#FNanchor_114" class="label">114</a>
That is to say, the sore is rather flabby than fungous;
for cancerous ulcers which begin superficially, and
without previous abscess, remain a considerable time without
forming fungus; but when an abscess bursts, and the
skin ulcerates in consequence, then the sore is not superficial,
but communicates with the abscess, which forms
fungus quickly.</p></div>

Mr. Hunter supposes, that the mere absorption of
schirrous substance before matter be formed, will affect the
glands; but it is difficult to ascertain the certainty of this,
as small abscesses are formed very early. I have formerly
mentioned, that every part of the animal is changed in its
nature, at the moment of being absorbed: If so, schirrous
substances lose all specific property, and cannot affect the
glands. Pus, again, being a foreign matter, is absorbed
unchanged, and continues so until it reaches the glands.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_126" href="#FNanchor_126" class="label">126</a>
It may be said, that different parts have different susceptibilities
of assuming the morbid condition; that the
bones are longer of becoming affected than the soft parts,
&amp;c. Admit this, and still it must be explained, why every
part of a similar structure, &amp;c. should not be affected at
the same moment. All the glands should become diseased
at once; all the bones should inflame at the same time;
and, instead of finding one or two organs affected, in consequence
of the previous existence of a local disease, we
should find the whole system rapidly becoming diseased.</p></div>

It was supposed, that when the menses were obstructed,
the impurities were sent by communicating vessels to
the breast, where they lodged, and produced cancer. Vide
Vesalii Opera, p. 1092. Fabricius de Tum. p. 118.
</p>
<p>
Le Dran observes, that when schirrus, from any cause,
takes place in the breast, before the cessation of the menses,
it uniformly becomes more painful when any irregularity
of that discharge occurs. Vide Memoires de l’Acad.
de Chirurg. Tom. III. p. 22.</p></div>

be considered in the same light with simple schirri.</p></div>

The simple schirrus now assumes that specific mode
of inflammatory action which it is to continue, and may
now be called the scrophulous or cancerous inflamed
schirrus.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131" class="label">131</a>
Schirrus has generally been enumerated as one of the
terminations of inflammation; but it cannot, properly
speaking, be considered as such. There are only two
kinds of termination, one in death, as, for instance, gangrene;
the other in recovery, which is accomplished either
directly by resolution, or indirectly by suppuration.
Schirrus is not produced by a perfect and complete cessation
of inflammation, but by a continuance of a low degree
of inflammation, which renders the state of tumefaction
which attends it natural to the part, before it goes off.
This state, then, is not a termination of inflammation, but
a consequence of its continuance.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="label">132</a>
I have known two cases of this kind; in both the eye
was affected. One boy had his eye extirpated; but a
small part being left by the surgeon at the angle, the disease
returned, and proved fatal. In another, the disease
was in its incipient stage; but the relations would not
submit to an operation.</p></div>

Arsenic mixed with sulphur, and powdered crow-foot,

composition. Mixed with forty times its weight of powder

was much in repute in North America.</p></div>

a case, in which, by destroying the skin with lunar
caustic, and then applying arsenic, he removed the gland.

proportion of two parts of the first to one of the last.
This was powdered and mixed with equal parts of powdered

As different parcels of this medicine may not be of

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
